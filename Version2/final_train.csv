"I try so hard to feel happy. I really do. Ive tried the ‚Äúfake it till you make it‚Äù method and it hurts to keep going that way. I really dont know what to do anymore. I try telling my mom and she just says i need to stop thinking im depressed b/c im actually not. Which makes me feel pathetic. I try reaching out for help but when i do, they just make it about themselves and how selfish I am. I have an appointment tomorrow for a psychological evaluation and i am really nervous. Yes i have been diagnosed before and have taken medication. But i was already getting off most of them. And now im falling down again. I just want to get better.

"I've kind of turned into a serial crusher due to my crippling loneliness.

Does anyone know how to be more comfortable being alone? I always end up putting so much time and effort into these crushes that don't mean anything to me.

"Hi there, so on the 21st of December my doctor prescribed me 20mg Citalopram (Celexa) for my anxiety, depression, CPTSD and OCD symptoms. Unfortunately at the exact same time I became quite ill with the most troubling symptom being difficulty and pain urinating so the doctor told me to quit the drug to rule it out. I'm still struggling a little bit with this now after a week of being off of the drug, but it turns out it's actually just pretty bad constipation. That's getting better now so I'm wanting to give the medication another go, but I'm really worried about the sexual part of the side effects. The few days I was on Citalopram, I lost all interest in sex. My penis felt pretty much numb and masturbating just to relieve myself was a stressful chore thanks to the delayed ejaculation. I've heard quite a lot about how these are side effects that don't really pass with time and may even continue after treatment with the drug stops, that's terrifying to me. What's the use in getting me out of this depression and anxiety and possibly being able to get myself another girlfriend if I'm not even going to be able to perform properly anyway? Or even enjoy it? This might be a deal breaker for me so I was wondering if anybody has had any positive experiences with this? Did it pass over time or go back to normal as soon as you quit the drug? Thanks TLDR: Scared of the sexual side effects of Celexa, any positive experiences to ease my worry?",0,,,

"Hey everyone! Quick little backstory: I am 22 years old and have suffered from depression since I was around age 14. During that time I took Zoloft with a Xanax PRN for panic attacks. Earlier this year (around May 2017) my primary doctor upped my dosage by 50mg, I was then taking 150mg. My body adjusted to the increase and I hated how it made me feel. I felt worse than before. As if it worsened my symptoms. So, full well knowing the dangers of stopping a medication like Zoloft, I stopped taking it around the end of July 2017. At first I was fine. Them a month had gone by and I was bad. Then a few months later (Nov 2017) I was the worst I had ever been in my life. I lost 20lbs from Thanksgiving to now... I don't have an appetite, even though I feel hungry all the time. I have extreme fatigue. I am always tired, no matter how much sleep I get. I am stressed because student loans kick in this month ($515 a month), and I cannot afford to visit my family doctor because of $ I owe from previous visits. Is this 20lb sudden weight loss something that can be attributed to depression? I am generally a very healthy person. I workout daily, but haven't been able to the past month because of my extreme fatigue and depression. That's why it confuses me as to why I've lost weight. I am 22, female, athletic build, 6'0"" and 178lbs. Sorry if this is in the wrong subreddit. If it is, please direct me elsewhere. Thank you guys for your time. ‚ù§",0,,,
"Sorry for the very melodramatic title. The point is, i have suffered from depression and I have gotten over it about 2 years ago, but everything that goes a little downhill in my life spurs this fear that I might not be able to be ""normal"". This isn't a cry for help or anything useful at all, but I'm just writing this for personal solace. However I am interested to see if anybody who has gone through depression has this same fear of going back into the cycle.",0,,,
"So my boyfriend has pretty severe depression. I'm the only person he talks to about it, and it's good that he can at least talk to someone, but I think he should tell his parents so he could try to get professional help. He refuses to talk to anyone but me about it and believes that a therapist can't help him, no matter how hard I've tried to convince him. He also believes taking medicine wouldn't help, even though I have tried to convince him. He is suicidal at least once a day and I'm worried that one day he will just do it. Any ways to help him (I know everyone is different but any general advice) would be appreciated.",0,,,

"In the last month I spent my birthday, Christmas, and new year entirely alone. I likely failed at least one of my exams. Almost every night I've woken up in fear from a nightmare in which my only friend dies. Two months ago was the last time I went into work and the last time I went to most of my classes. I told everyone I was too busy, but the truth is I was too anxious to leave my apartment. It felt too much like I was just failing. Three months ago is when I discovered that my depression may be caused by a chronic vitamin deficiency, which I would have been suffering from for over 10 years without knowing. A disorder that could have equally significant impact on my brain and body, which it may have already. This month I'm going to get checked to see if I'm right. If I am, then my dream career is a bust. If I'm wrong, I'm right back to square one and most likely going to end it. I'm in a lose-lose situation. The only thing keeping me going anymore is the fact that I don't know how my friend would handle it. She has big dreams that she can absolutely attain, but if she cares about me even a fraction as much as I care about her then coping with my death could ruin everything. Yet at the same time my presence in her life has been a fairly consistent cause of stress. Another lose-lose. I don't know what to do. I can't live for myself and I can't live for her. But dying isn't an option either right now. My life is a giant Chinese finger trap.",0,,,

"Hi I'm going to be seeing a therapist for the first time in a while, at the urging of my partner.

I fell thousands of dollars in debt from helping her with everything she needed from phones to car payments. I met my best friend fell completely in love with her thought she felt the same way so I asked her out she turned me down. everything was fine (I just loved her company) until 2 weeks ago she started dating and I never really see her anymore and is now about to move away.... I'm stuck living with my parents who tell me how everything I do is wrong how I should have a 50k+ income how I should have moved out 2 years ago becomes it's easy to afford to live. I can't afford to move out alone I truly thought she loved me and we were simply going to get a apartment we even talked about it a lot to the point we looked at some.. I'm ending 2016 thousands in debt alone and depressed knowing there will never be anyone there for me when I need them my few friends I consider family and I would do anything for them (from buying tires to food to giving them a ride) and I like to think that they would be there for me... but this year has shown me that's not the case that non of them truly care about me...

"Welp, I made it to 2018, these past few months have been absolutely terrible yet filled with many good memories, and I've met new people and made new friends too. Things are looking okay so far, I'm talking to a sweet and kind girl that I hope I can have a future with, and I've found something to be excited about. That something being music, specifically Metal and Dungeon Synth. I've also gathered a bit of energy and motivation and can hopefully use that to lose weight and learn some instruments. Hopefully things stay this way, because I'm still a sad fuck and any little thing can send me back to where I was a couple nights ago. Lonely, crying, and wanting to scatter my brains around my room because I felt like a worthless angry fuck. Well, I still feel the same but it isn't as bad as it was then.

"The summer of 2019 I started developing severe OCD after suffering from mild, unnoticeable OCD for many years. I just feel so tired of things, so bored of living, but I can't commit suicide. I know that there are people who care about about me, like my parents, and the shit they would have to go trough if I commited suicide is unbearable for me to imagine. But I just wished I didn't exist, that I never was born. I wish I could vanish from this world, be gone like the wind. I often wish I would die in an accident or disease, because maybe that would be less painful for the people around me then if I would commit suicide. I have stayed home from school for about 2 months because of illness related to the stress, not stress from school, but from my mental health. I feel crippled. One day I woke up and was completely emotionally numb. I couldn't feel happiness, sadness, anger or any other emotion, but it got better. But I really wished it wouldn't have gotten better, it was ""amazing"", I couldn't either feel anxiety so all I felt was blank.

"I have never been diagnosed with depression or even talked to a professional about it being a possibility. But I used to think about it a lot. Especially during the last several years of my previous relationship. I felt like the worst human being because my SO was actually a wonderful person, but I couldn't bring myself to feel happy. Instead, I felt trapped. I often thought I would eventually have to consider suicide if I wanted to get out of it, but I didn't need to worry because I wasn't at that stage yet. I just cried a lot. I also grew to find self harm theraputic, but knew I wouldn't do anything 'too far'. When I did end that relationship, I did an emotional 180, which let me justify and blame all those feelings on the relationship. And up until now I believed that. I have been in my current relationship for a little less than a year and I am just starting to feel myself sink. But this time it has nothing to do with my SO. In fact, I'm terrified because I'm so invested in them and I don't want them to see me this way. I'm scared of losing them because all I can do is sit around and be a pathetic mop of a person. I know how good my life is right now so I don't want to do anything to damage it. I don't have anyone that I am comfortable opening up to with my emotional stuff.

I don't even know myself anymore. I don't have any more passion for things I once did (cooking, massage therapy). I attempt to develop motivation, but my depression and anxiety will team up with the PTSD I incurred from being robbed. When I notice negative self-talk, I'll try to change my thought patterns, but it always ends up back at ""The world would be better off if you were gone."" But I'm too much of a coward to try and take myself out again... I just want to be happy, man.

For years I've wanted to reconnect with the people I shut out, but I've become trapped in a self-destructive cycle where I'm too ashamed to admit my problems to the same people I just want to make proud.

Even though I have no evidence this will happen I am gripped by the fear that they will think I'm annoying (oversharing?) when I think about telling them this stuff, or I start to think about how maybe they will abandon me if they knew how sad I really was. I think that talking about stuff sometimes does make you feel better... just to unload that stuff. But I feel like I'm really making people suffer by telling them and so I end up suffering alone. What do I do??? I honestly need an appointment with my therapist today, but I have to wait till the 3rd and I feel like stuff could burst out of me before then that will alert people to my depression which I don't want. And all this is made worse by the fact that I'm not actually diagnosed. My therapist said it's not pathological what I have, but I feel completely alone in my thoughts and feelings all the time. If the act of me killing myself wouldn't affect people like my family and friends, especially my mom, I would have done it already.",0,,,

As if being pushed around all over the place and treated as a 3rd dish is what I deserve that is according to their point of view. Though I'm exhausted of being treated this way, maybe it's because I'm such a good person all the time. It seems that I have a tag in my back reading ""Do what you want with me, I will always be there to recieve your shit with open arms, no side effects"". I'm fucking tired of being treated as a mattress where they can lay in when the world fails them. It seems that my being doesn't inspire to be treated seriously and I'm not worth a thing. Maybe I need to be less of a good person, I really don't know, but I'm starting to think that I should scream all the swear words that I can imagine even if this makes me look as the enemy.",1," people around me, seeing myself as a lifeboat or a complementary support",I'm not worth a thing,

I am anxious around people which make me a different human which make more difficult to make friends. There were some people in my life which I thought would stay around me so I ignored toxicity and thought it will become better but it backfired me because when I tried to talk to them about what they have done to me they turned the table around me and blamed me for all.

Although i finally have a plan towards recovery and medication as my tool, i chose to seek help after this past semester had ended. Due to my mental illness I couldn't do my best academically to get out of my academic probation (a result of failing to seek help earlier than later) and such I'm facing dismissal from my college. All i needed is one more semester to graduate. But there is hope :), I chose to appeal the dismissal and had to write a 3 paragraph max explaining the circumstances that affected my academic performance and a plan towards success.

"When I am in the midst of hell, crippling, debilitating depression (much like now) I always repeat one line from a song called ""Mamma Sed"" by Puscifer over and over again. It doesnt help at first, but the more time that passes the more sense it starts to make. Here is the lyric: ""Momma said, like the rain, this too shall pass. Like a kidney stone, this too shall pass."" I just love it because the cliche saying ""like the rain this too shall pass"" doesn't exactly capture what we go through in times like these. But ""like a kidney stone"" sums it up just perfectly. What you are experiencing is going to hurt like FUCKING HELL.

"The reason I drink is to self medicate because I saw my friend pass away in a car accident when I was 19. We were both stupid and I challenged him to a race using our parents cars. Basically, he understeered into a tree. I have tried therapy but it didn't work for me. I was also diagnosed with PTSD and depression. I stopped taking my prescription because it didn't work for me. I feel that I have blood on my hands because I was the one who made him do it. My parents and grandfather came to me and told me that they were worried about my drinking problem. I sometimes drink a bottle of Vodka a day. I just want to drink myself to death because I'm too scared of killing myself. My granddad tried to relate to the situation by telling me about the things he was in Vietnam. I walked out because I was upset about everything. I now think that I was out of order and I would do anything to apologise. But at the same time, I feel that they shouldn't have bought my grandfather along because he is getting Parkinsons disease so I don't want him to worry about me as well.",0,,,
"2016 was probably one of the most difficult years with my depression and I think a big reason for that is because I let it. I pushed people away, not because I wanted to be alone, but because it was less exhausting than going out and doing stuff. I waited way to long to go back to my therapist and it just continued to snowball to the point that I felt there was no way out of it. I've recently taken a big step towards improving my well being and I am hoping that this will make 2017 a little more bearable. This step, being medication, has been something I've been reluctant to take as I felt like a failure. In hindsight, it's really no different than taking a medication for any other illness and in order to get better I think this is something I have to do. Cheers to a better 2017 for anyone fighting an illness.",0,,,

"These boards are riddled with self contempt and self loathing, which is naturally what you might expect on depression boards. Im not condemning anyone for expressing the pain they are dealing with, but why are there never posts or replies with constructive, helpful advice on how to move forward and make progress towards combatting this illness. The few that are posted are overlooked and ignored in favor of discussing symptoms. Someone posts on here that they often feel like killing themselves and they get a myriad of posts from people who just tell them they also feel that way. The poster feels support knowing there are other people out there just like them, but what use or aid is there in this overall? It is probably more harmful than helpful. I've been a long time lurker on these forums, also suffering myself, and I see that many people feel support and solidarity with those suffering here. Yet I can't help but feel that we are all dragging each other down. You don't cure a disease by just communing with others who have the disease and complaining about your symptoms. You make small incremental changes towards wellness to get better, and I never see any suggestions on this subreddit for people to do that.",0,,,

It feels so nice to have someone actually understand me for once, and understand what's happening, and how my situation is.

"So that I could see exactly why I'm so repulsive. I have no idea what it is. I used to just tell myself it's because I'm not super attractive but now I'm getting paranoid I drive people away with some shitty aura that is completely out of my control. This is arguably worse because at least I can work on my physical appearance to a degree. I try so hard to be there for people, try to be a good friend, etc. But eventually everyone just drops me anyway. I can't be myself around people because who I really am is a depressed, negative, pessimistic, hopeless, self loathing piece of shit. I can't help it, this is what you become when life and people shit all over you for years on end. So I try to be more positive, but I have to fake it because I'm naturally a depressing downer. I don't know what it is but people don't seem to ever want to stick around in my life. It seems like everyone just eventually vanishes into thin air and stops talking to me all of a sudden. This goes for relationships but it also applies to some friendships that I mistakenly believed were very close.

"Hi guys, long time reader first time poster here. A year ago I moved into an apartment in a brand new city. I remember being so excited for all the things I'd be able to do. I'd get a job, get to a gym membership, and even join a few social groups. Well, after a year, nothings really changed. I applied for a lot of jobs and ended up going to a decent number of interviews. Nothing ever came of them and after June passed me by I lost my nerve to even really look anymore. I did end up getting a gym membership but I've never really used it though. I know I shouldn't procrastinate like this but I'm never able to find the energy. I haven't been able to find any groups or friends while I've been here either. I've looked but the only groups I've been able to find have been smaller groups that cater to people a lot older than I am. It's been getting harder and harder to find motivation to get out of bed or go outside for a long time now. As I don't have a car, I'd have to take the bus to go anywhere which would eat up most of my day. I haven't really been able to derive any sense or pleasure from much anything these days. I'm just letting the time pass. Next week, I'm starting university and I'd like to enjoy this time of my life. But I know that it'll probably end the same as all the years I spent at community college did, with nothing of significance happening and not making any friends.",0,,,
"Ive always been denying that I might have depression and thinking im stronger than that.. But lately Ive been feeling so miserable.

It‚Äôs so hard for me to express what im feeling and ive tried talking to professionals (in my school) and when im talking to them I dont feel what I feel when im alone so they dont understand, not saying i understand either because i dont know whats wrong with me or why i feel like this.

"I just left a happy but low paid job which I excelled at for one with better money and better prospects. But I absolutely hate it. I hate the thought of being there. I hate the thought of not being able to do the job. I hate how much more of my time it takes up despite only being contracted for two more hours than I was at my previous job. I understand that there comes nerves with a new start but I'm starting to wonder if it's all worth the effort if I was so much happier in my previous job, not just doing the work but it didn't invade my life with thoughts when I wasn't there. I have suffered from depression before, though not connected to work, and I can feel that the longer I am at my new job the less I'm enjoying my life. I've been absolutely miserable and unwanting to do anything in the past week. I don't know what to do. Any kind words would be greatly appreciated.",0,,,
"For a few months it's been overwhelming. I've lost multiple friends in the last two months alone due to how I act. I dont think I'm exactly wrong, but I only kept about 2 to 3 friends and now they just wont contact me. I feel insignificant contacting them because I've only gotten a response once or twice. I'm falling out of my work schedule, every night thinking of how I would end myself until i realize I'm thinking about it. The past six months have been so hard on me, and I'm only 20. I know i have many years more to live but it feels so hopeless as i think that I'm gonna die one day, why keep feeling like this forever? I feel like I have no hold over my life, I cant stay in one place for long, much less keep a steady job. In the moment I just say fuck it and quit and move on to another, I dropped out and am an alcoholic. I cant clean because it feels hopeless as well, everything just piles up until I'm at this point, and this time i dont know if i can move on. My dreams are repetitive and of the same person, and i cant shake that no matter what i try. Right now just seems like the time to save my family the pain of doing it later and just ending it. I dont know what to do. I want to make an impact on the world but know the chances are oh so slim, and it seems a lot easier to die.",0,,,

"Ok so while this is definitely not my first time going to counseling, this was the first meeting with a new counsellor. It was set up through my work's EAP service, which I've used before with limited success. Anyway, I had my first session this week and it was weird. First of all, it was in a very unconventional location. It was in an office (I mean literally a room with a desk and some office chairs), inside an organization not typically known for mental health services. So that was weird and it took me a while to get comfortable enough to start talking. Since this was the first session, most of it was just me explaining what was going on in my life and why I'm there. Anyway, near the end she remarked that I was a fascinating person and she really wants to talk to me more. That's my first time hearing that, especially from a professional. Then she asked me if I was familiar with the mbti, to which I replied I am not a fan. She also suggested I check out metaphysics because it might help me or something. I Dunno , I walked out of there feeling strange. On one hand, the counselor was nice and all, but on the other hand, certain things made me a bit uncomfortable. Anybody else have any similar experiences? Should I stick with it or find someone else?",0,,,

"I'm a 20 year old male college student. Before college and the year and a half hell I've been living in, I always felt like happiness did not come easily to me. I recognized early on that unlike my friends, I had to actively work for any semblance of happiness and peace. Once I started college, my old friend sexual performance anxiety came back full force and hasn't left. Being at one of the nations biggest party schools and mecca for beautiful girls my age, feeling left out of the one thing that all human cultures around the world share feels bad man. This has created a gaping hole inside me that I fill with booze and pot. I've been at rock bottom for a while now, and I know that recovering from this depression and involuntary celibacy will be the hardest battle I've yet to fight in my life. I feel like a morbidly obese person who has to lose 300 lbs but hasn't started yet. Everyone who loves me encourages me to fix my life, but looking at life, society, and the human condition from rock bottom changes you. After you tell yourself you'd rather be dead a certain amount of times, your outlook on life and the universe as a whole really does drastically change. When I look into my future, I see years of battling this dark and disparaging side of me. Why do I have to work so hard to subject myself to the daily delusion of being a human being in the modern world?",0,,,

"Depression it‚Äôs a bitch. Its like there is a constant voice in your head telling you that you are worthless, pathetic, useless, a failure, a disappointment that you dont deserve happiness or to be alive but to only feel pain. It makes you feel like you are forever trapped in an abyss with no way of crawling out. Sometimes you can see the light at the end of the tunnel but it always drags you back deeper than you‚Äôve gone before and the impossible cycle of escaping begins again. No matter how much you try to escape the darkness, your brain yearns for the dark thoughts to return because it happens so frequently that it becomes the comfort zone for it. You begin to doubt everything about yourself; telling yourself whatever you do isnt good enough and you should just stop trying or its worthless to just go on and might be better to just end it all. You feel like you are nothing and will be important to anyone ever and when you are gone everyone will be happier knowing the pathetic failure that they once knew will be gone forever and can no longer fuck up their lives. All the smiles on the outside is just a mask to cover how you really feel. You cut because you feel like you deserve the sharp stinging sensation as the blade cuts your arm open and the blood slowing oozing out. Afterwards you are left with scars as a constant reminder of the pain you cause others and how worthless you are.",1,Depression,"you are worthless, pathetic, useless, a failure, a disappointment that you dont deserve happiness or to be alive but to only feel pain, doubt everything about yourself, telling yourself whatever you do isnt good enough, feel like you are nothing, when you are gone everyone will be happier knowing the pathetic failure that they once knew will be gone forever, how worthless you are","end it all, deserve the sharp stinging sensation as the blade cuts your arm open and the blood slowing oozing out"

"I'm currently underemployed as a sub teacher, but hardly do that. I've let my mental health get out of control, as well as a string of bad luck that exacerbated my problems that was out of my control more or less. I feel really committed to turning my life around and not feeling mentally ill or bad or whatever, but I don't know when to say ""Today was a good day, you did laundry, took a shower and shaved, took 1 sub job this week, and applied for one job today, exercised for three mins, meditated for 10"" and When to say ""that isn't enough, you can't survive this way. You need to set the goals higher, and you should/can set them higher"" I guess, if that makes sense. How do we set goals, do you need to practice feeling good about those goals? As any goal achievement a good day? I guess it's OK to feel bad about low goal achievement(IE, I shaved today, today was a good day, that feels more insane to me than thinking about killing myself) and that you should practice feeling good goal achievement, no matter the amount or degree of goals achieved? Is it about effort? Can effort be enough? I know I'm rambling but I'm just trying to get some ideas flowing.",0,,,

"All of my life I've struggled to fit in, which coupled with lots of stress and anxiety drove me to depression. I was incredibly lonely, spending my days sleeping and staring into a screen. This year gave me hope though, I met the most amazing girl imaginable - intelligent, funny, sweet/kind, romantic, sexy, same interests, everything I've ever wanted. She was the first girl I've ever dated, someone who actually saw me as something other than the ugly, awkward guy. I actually planned to kill myself around that time, but it all went away after that. I was the happiest guy in the world. That all changed though after she suddenly attempted suicide a few weeks ago. Now all she does is push me away when I try to be there for her (going as far as to dump me) and refuses to see anything beside the negative no matter how much I try to reassure her. She's like an entirely different person now, definitely not the same girl that told me she loved me every night. Meanwhile, I'm even worse than I was before.

Two years ago, I already took a break because of depression, and saw what I could be without it. It was awesome. And now.. I'm missing school again. I feel emptier and emptier, and dumber every day.

"" Jesus, even typing this is horrible. But I can't stop thinking this is terribly true. I keep realizing i'm not intelligent.

He told me I was different from normal girl I didnt deserve a good life. It was discovered two years ago that I was adopted. Neither my mom or my dad are my biological parent. And in my country it is a shame, an orphan usually treated very bad and deserved to be a maid. I had a nightmare about this and I remembered all my father told me and his family when I was kid. I could not take it anymore. I really want to die. I dont really have a purpose on my life. I dont know why I should life.

I've been thinking more about self harm recently. A lot more about it. I haven't done it yet but I've been close to doing it and I'm scared and worried but I can't stop thinking about it.

"I am in the hospital. I suffer from several chronic illnesses and have spent the whole year here. Only 22 years old. I graduated from college a year ago and haven't done anything since. I was a model, a news anchor, a girlfriend, an aunt, a sister, daughter, friend, and now i'm none of those things (besides a sister &amp; aunt. but i never see them.) I'll be dead in 2017 due to my illnesses. I have decided to end my life tonight before midnight. I have a lot of drugs at my disposal-enough to kill a horse-and no one checking on me until morning. I'm doing it. My mind is made up. My depression from these illnesses is the deepest sense of hopelessness i've ever felt. I do not want to die, but living this life is unimaginable for any longer. I want to get married, work, work out, pursue my dreams, have kids, have pets, help others...but i can't. so what is the use in living as a vegetable? I cannot do it anymore. I just wanted to post this here because i have no one. Oh, and i'm ""social media famous"" because I'm pretty but no one knows how dead inside i am. I tried. I made it a year. But no longer",0,,,

"The method of suicide I selected is hypothermia. There's a river near my house with 40 degree water Fahrenheit, 4 degrees Celsius. Being in there at night, no one would see me. I would tie a rope to a life jacket and confine myself to a tree so I don't drift along the current to a spot where someone would find me. Death would occur within a couple of hours of being in the water, and unconsciousness would happen before then. This method is easy to pull off because it doesn't involve highly intense pain, and I can get out if I really want to. The problem is that this isn't going to work soon, due to the warmer seasons approaching. I have to quickly decide if I want to die. I'm afraid that if I don't act now, I'll regret it and have to endure life for another year, but I'm also not 100% set on death just yet.",0,,,

"Three years ago my dad died, it hardly feels like three weeks. It's like everything else in my life is so insignificant in comparison, it's like a black hole that distorts my perception of time. It's as if time passes 100x faster since it and everything before it is so long ago. People say that after a major event in their life everything feels categorised into before and after it but to me it feels like things that are it and not, but most of them are. People have been telling me since then that I probably have depression and should maybe get help but that's mostly just from seeing me because I don't open up. I feel like I've just always been a little gloomy and don't feel very different now compared to before other than the whole bending of time thing. People say they noticed a change in me, but I didn't, maybe they just expect something like that to mess up a 14 year old?",0,,,
"Hey, I created an account because I honestly dont know what I am doing anymore on here. Last year was the worst of my life. My long time GF (4 years) and I broke up. She lives in a different state so I flew there to speak to her and atleast end it on good terms. The day after I started a new job. It started well with my manager happy but the next week I had another manager who joined (the person who hired me was sacked). Towards the end of the first month, I ended up having surgery on my back. This is where the issues started, The surgery and the breakup really affected me physically and mentally and I kept making errors which were easily avoidable. Eventually it got too much for them and they released me. It took me 3 years to find the job in my field which I graduated in and i honestly thought it was what I was looking for. Unfortunately, I got left with no job and now no partner. I have a job now - in my field but not exactly the same (if that makes sense) but it is really going nowhere. My manager is good and is happy with my performance but the organisation does not allow for any growth. The person who I replaced is younger than me and is already far ahead in their career than I will. To top it all off, I live in a small town and it will be hard to hide the termination. I honestly dont know what is the point anymore. No matter what I do, it feels it is never enough and I am not going anywhere",0,,,

"My parents are divorced since I was 3. No big deal, many people started off worse. I've been living with my mom and rarely meet my dad because I'm too busy.

She thought the other parents were overreacting. Personally I do feel off balance at times, and I WOULD get myself tested just to see if I'm okay or not. But even when I expressed that wish, mom still wouldn't take it more seriously and ignore it. I don't want to come to my dad crying out for help because that would just make my mom and dad argue once more, and many many more problems regarding my family might ensue.

"I was diagnosed with depression about 5 years ago and got prescribed prozac by my doctor at the time. About a month after taking it, I felt really self-loathing and just worse in general, instead of better. It got to the point where I nearly made an attempt on my life and got taken to the emergency room where they confiscated the medication off me. Some time went by and I decided to go back again, this time they referred me for therapy, but the waiting list went on for a year and I still heard nothing (I'm in UK where NHS have free services, I couldn't afford private counselling). The last time I went was about 2 months ago where they offered me medication again. I decided to tell them I wasn't very keen on the idea of taking anti-depressants due to what happened before, and I also mentioned that I waited a year for therapy but it never fell through, and they said something among the lines of ""we're not sure what to do then"".

"Hi guys, I might need some help. I'm dangerously close to becoming a full alcoholic. Whenever I feel down, i grab the bottle. Sometimes I get drunk 3 times a week, the minimum is 2, but sometimes it's even 6 times a week. Just got out of an 11 day drinking binge. I'm only 18, I can't let the booze take over.

I am smarter, more social, don't think about my problems as much (until an hour after the last glass, then the depression really hits hard.). I just always feel like I have wasted the last 18 years of my life. I have litteraly nothing to be proud of. It hits hardest when my friends asked what I've done all day, and I just have nothing to say. So whenever I'm down, I'll get drunk, knowing I'll feel better for a while. The depression itself isn't that bad, it's not always there. I feel perfect half the time. Dunno if it's even a real depression. Took half an hour just writing this, as I can't type correctly anymore, so I have to write the whole thing basically three times to make it correct.

"I met this guy 2 years ago with whom I became best friend (although honestly I probably fell in love with him). He got back with his ex last year and since then I've just been spiralling down. When we're together, he keeps texting with his bf, and we barely have interesting conversations (we used to always hang out together and talk about everything). He keeps saying that he's my best friend, and he keeps saying that I'm very special to him, but he doesn't really act that way. Their relationship is long-distance and when he's with his boyfriend he barely texts me. I tried distancing myself, but he's scared he's gonna lose me so he doesn't give me a lot of space. I spent last January-March severely depressed and ended up seeing a therapist. I managed to get out of the darkness, but these days I've been faltering. Especially since he's with him now for NYE and I'm stuck with my parents and I don't expect myself having a good time...

"My high school career wasnt the best but it certainly was full of great memories and long term friendships *(some of which I am still in contact with over a decade later)*. Whenever I go through old pictures or Facebook posts/messages from my high school days, I instantly feel sad and depressed because of how much fun those days were and that I can never re-live those amazing days ever again. What makes this feeling worse is that I've lost contact with many of my close high school friends so even if I wanted to get in contact with them again, it couldnt happen. Some I know have moved to different cities/countries and some now have families and established careers and im just sitting here going through old memories wishing that I could re-live those days. We're all happy when high school is finally over but many years later, that feeling isnt the same anymore. I know its not just me who feels this way but this feeling F'ing sucks and at the same time I dont want to get rid of those memories that keep bringing those feelings back because they mean a lot to me. It just sucks that I cant do anything to bring those days back.",0,,,

My scars and cynicism are just a little too hard for anyone who tries to stay around too long. Hubby has been in my atmosphere for 7 years...think it's finally getting through to him that I can not change the abuse I suffered, and the PTSD that resides in me and rears it's ugly head now and then.

I'm 31, my career is a trainwreck right now, got no friends anymore nor a SO and parents are getting old so soon I won't even have a family. Parts of this text that talk about social capital really resonate with me since many of the examples it mentions I did experience before but couldn't figure out what was happening at the time.

"Over the course of my life, I have attempted suicide four times. Each time, I was hospitalized, and each time I've tried again. The last times, it failed because someone found and stopped me. My ex boyfriend commit suicide last year. I have difficulty making plans due to a mild obsessive compulsive disorder, and just finding time. I have a heart condition that has been steadily worsening after a miscarriage, and due to it, I can't hold down a regular job and have since resorted to online work that pays like shit. I'm homeless. I have only two people in any sort of position to provide support, emotionally. And even though it's looking like the most difficult parts of life are ending and getting better for me, I don't honestly believe a life with all these new restrictions is worth it. My family is going on vacation soon. I wasn't invited. That week, I can complete the steps the way I planned, if I want to. Now the question is if I even have the physical strength for one last shot at it. Who knows? It might fail again. But I have no doubt I'll keep trying. It's the only thing I haven't given up on. Meditation and such seems to point me in this direction. Tarot readings, horoscopes, all of it seems to be dropping hints that this is it. The main difference between all the times before, is that this time, I have nothing left to be afraid of. We can't forgive ourselves for all the things we did not become.",0,,,

I am going in tomorrow to work at mcdonalds while I try to get a job over at the niche mom and pop restaurant near my house. I have job experience and I'm not unemployed, thank god for that, but I'm just feeling depressed and reminiscing about my past and what I could've changed about it, although, there was little room for it. Sometimes it makes me feel liberated feeling like I regret nothing for having dealt with and going to deal with rough shit, but the feeling remains that nobody will ever take me seriously and I fucked up.

I could do any one of those things right now, but it wouldn't make me feel better. It would make me feel worse for trying to 'take care of' myself like I'm some wounded baby that needs nursing.""

"I **need** this year to be better. I'm nearing the end of my third year of college. The new semester is approaching quickly, and I desperately need a good one in order to save me from failing. I failed two courses last semester. I was miserably depressed the whole time and it showed on my GPA. That was my free pass; I can't afford to fail any more. If I do, I won't graduate on time. If I don't graduate on time, I don't graduate at all because they'll cut $8000 of financial aid and I can't magically come up with that money myself. But this year doesn't have to be like that. I don't believe all of the bullshit about how the new year promises change and hope. It's literally just another day, except the year is different. Still, I'm mildly optimistic. I've never been a hard worker, but that has to change now. I know exactly what I have to do to be a successful student; doing it is just impossible sometimes. My depression is like a roller coaster. Before Christmas I felt amazing, and now I feel empty and broken inside. That worries me: if it comes back in full force in the middle of the semester, that could cause a great deal of damage. Regardless, I wish you all a great new year. Hopefully this one won't be quite as shitty.",0,,,
"I finally got some form of disability for my epilepsy, it's not much but I am no longer worrying about money. I don't have to ever worry about working another factory or fastfood job again. I can finally afford to and focus on school. I will never get my learners permit or driver's license still. But I pretty much gave up on that as soon as I was diagnosed. I am really passionate about animation so I feel so blessed to be able to pursue that now. Funny how a lil extra cash can make life a lot better.

However, due to events in recent months, I feel so empty, like I don't give a fuck about doing anything. Even feeding myself has become something I try to avoid. I don't take care of my appearance, I do the minimal work I need to get by and I rarely socialize with the few friends I have. These are part in part to a belief that has formed in my head: life is meaningless. What is the point of doing anything? We slave away through school, to get a place at university, then we slave away through uni to get a good degree, then we slave away in a job we will probably hate to make sure we don't end up on the streets. All this, all this pointless cycle and in the grand scheme if things, it makes no difference. I think a lot of times to myself, if I were to disappear now, would anything be affected? Have I had any impact at all on the world? Will I even be remembered? The answers are always no. This has produced an emptiness inside me. The emptiness leads to a lack of people, activities and more, which in turn leave me feeling lonely and unfulfilled respectively. Yet I again feel a lack of desire to do anything. I don't know what this is or why I think like this, but I would appreciate it if anyone could give me some sort of method or exercise to break this cycle.",0,,,

Well, they said I could either resign or they would start termination procedures. I‚Äôd never talked to them about my depression, and how it‚Äôs ruining every part of my life, not just work. I tried my best to explain it and how it was effecting me (when I could pull myself together). They were very kind and understanding, but it didn‚Äôt change anything. They don‚Äôt want me there.

"So, been a long time since I posted (used throwaway but now I don't care) Basically, I was really depressed, I self harmed and attempted suicide once. After a while I decided I needed some company so I got a girlfriend. That in itself is an issue so I'll summarize it. She and I were happy but she said she was still in love with her ex. Thats when I realized I wasn't really happy with her. I broke up with her and was genuinely happy. This was about a mont and a half ago. Depression was gone and I was the best I could be. Then my friends started saying shit behind my back, that I was a fake and didn't have individuality. Basically mean things. Besides my friends were still (and still are) best friends with my ex. Like all of them.I started becoming left out. they stopped talking to me. (Literally the only chat I have with another person is my one true friend (Who doesn't respond to any of my messages even though he talks in groups) the rest I haven't had a chat since beginning of december) I keep telling myself that its okey. That I don't need them. I am probably right, But it feels really shitty. And to top it all of, my depression is coming back. I can feel it creeping up.

"I'm posting here because its anonymous and frankly I just wanted to speak my piece before I end it. I feel awful inside, everyday trying to mask the pain with busy work, or arrogance and charm towsrds others to distract myself. I've felt empty for quite some time. I finally opened up to my wife about these thoughts a year ago and she blamed me for how that made her feel knowing I want to kill myself. She left me some short time after. Since then I've had about 6 months of time to really digest my thoughts and feeling. I feel an incredible depression each day and then feel even worse when I think about my children having to deal with my death. For a long time that deterred me from suicide, now it seems more like a valid solution to my pain and a way for everyone to move on. I dont want anyone to find my body which clearly describes suicide. On the contrary I'd like to frame my death so the narrative suggests a noble death and therefore easier on my family. Of course my children love me, but it's been an incredibly long time since I've felt love or purpose. I feel like a paycheck, a slave to everyone else's needs, a pawn in someone else's game. I'm happy that I experienced love, excitement, danger, success but I feel now at the age of 35 the good days of ignorant bliss are behind me. Anyway, just figured I'd put this out here, to people that wouldn't tell me how selfish I am, or how this doesnt help anyone. I just want the pain to end.",0,,,
"My mother has been depressed most of her life from what I can tell. She and my father are separated. He's struggling with his own battle. I'm 24 in college and I live about an hour away. I come home nearly every holiday, because when I was living at home during community college she became very dependent on me(to do household chores, and support her emotionally). She's lost her white collar job about a year ago. She make some bad choices, transferred to a position that wasn't right for her, and got let go. Now she's working at a warehouse job that too physical for her(out of shape). I'm worried that her depression is getting worse and worse. I can't quit college to move back and take care of her. Nor, do I think that is the way to really help her. Every time I come home her house becomes dirtier and dirtier. She's missing bills, becoming more reclusive, and I'm worried she depleting her savings/retirement. She isn't taking care of herself and not really trying to fix any of this. She's becoming more disillusioned with her job search for another white collar job. She is going to therapy and taking medication, but I don't really see any improvement (actually the opposite). I don't know what to do. I really want to help her but I don't know how without enabling her dependence on me.",0,,,

"Happy New Year everybody. I've been on Reddit for a while but didn't know this place existed. I've had depression for a few years, but in my case, my depression comes and goes. So I can feel horrible for a whole month but after feel like I'm on top of the world for a bit. One of the sad realizations of 2017 for me is realizing that there are a lot more people who suffer from depression than I thought. I'm starting to build a good support group of friends and family when things get tough, but I haven't felt there are too many groups (to my knowledge) to talk about depression, except here. Are there any sort of discord groups or anything like that that focus on depression? Maybe even YouTubers that talk about their problems with depression. Sometimes depression hits me at the worst times, so there are times where I can't really talk to people for a bit because everyone could be at work or asleep. I think it would be cool to have a place to go to to talk with like minded people that is maybe a little faster than making a reddit post. I hope I can become active in this community as well. Anyway, Happy New Year, everybody.",0,,,
"I have been isolated for most of my life. Every possible action I could take to improve my life has been rendered meaningless by previous attempts at averting the disaster that will be my future. I feel like I am doomed forever and that nobody will love me. It's too late. I am way too far behind to catch up with the normal crowd. I have zero friends and literally no family to turn to in times of desperate need. I have tried talking to doctors and therapists and that never worked either. Whenever I bring up my problems, they say I am ""indulging in self pity"" or they treat me like I am blaming other people for my misery. What am I supposed to do when my whole life has sucked and on top of that, my depression is getting worse? It hurts whenever people try to take the situation and blame it on me, when they don't know me. Fuck them. I don't know the point of this post. But, one thing I am certain about is that I am ready to die. I don't know what to do with myself. I don't know how to turn around my life. I don't know how to find love and I doubt anyone will love me (and if you are going to tell me it's too early to kill myself, then let me tell you that for most people, it comes naturally without any hard work whatsoever. I, however, am miserable because I am a fuck up. An aberration. An anomaly).

"I have found that one of the main issues keeping me from being productive and moving forward is my inability to believe in myself.

If I can‚Äôt be better or get better, what‚Äôs the point? Why shouldn‚Äôt I just kill myself? I don‚Äôt want to keep trying. Life is boring.

And that NT people have no fucking frame of reference talking about depression, like I have no frame of reference talking to someone with bipolar, which brings me to my next point. &amp;nbsp; Depression isn't ""really sad,"" you can't even fucking be sad when you're depressed. You can't enjoy the things you used to enjoy. For me, depression has always been this suffocating apathy, and ""feeling"" isn't an option. I'm not crying because I'm sad, I'm crying because I'm feeling nothing, and it feels pointless. &amp;nbsp; I want to be a whole person. I'm not motivated.

"(25M) I've been dealing with depression since I was about 14. I've been to countless therapists/doctors and have never had any relief.

"When my ego dies, will it take me with it? It's a selfish creature. It needs to be the best. It needs to be important. It needs people to agree with it. It throws tantrums. It lashes out when it's made to feel small. It thrives when it elevates itself above others. It thrives when it acts as if I am its personal chariot. It beats me down, demanding more than I could ever give. It piles on while I lie on the floor. It lives in a fantasy world full of delusion and self importance. But I withstand. I persist. It's all I know. It hurts. I suffer at its hands. I'm blinded. I was blinded. Now I see. Its time has passed. Once it goes, I can live without imagined fear. Once it's gone, I can truly live. Tonight I go deeper. Tonight it howls in pain. Only the void listens. Tonight I will cry, but I won't turn. Tonight is the night my ego will die. Putting you out of your misery. Tomorrow I'll awake, but you'll no longer be here. I won't miss you.",0,,,
"Exactly a year ago, I turned up at my gf's (now ex) house. She wanted to be angry with me that day, she was walking towards me about to explode.... But I picked her up and ran away with her. She forgot even why she wanted to be angry with me for, we went IKEA to look at new stuff for her apartment and then we went to a cafe in which I took a selfie of us. We were so happy and cute together. That selfie popped up on my one year memories. Fast forward to now, we've been separated since end of October last year. She doesn't talk with me, she removed me from everything except Facebook. I am hurting every fucking day. I remember her, I remember all the good times we had, I remember the future plans we had with each other. I don't know exactly when she turned from loving me to leaving me. But I just wish she spoke to me about any concerns she was having. I made my mistakes too by not understanding exactly what she wanted. I just want that happiness we had a year ago. I just miss her so much. We both wanted to get married, but I told her, once I finish school or get a job, we will get married! She told me she loved me and always will. I told her I loved her unconditionally. I wish somehow we could redo our relationship because we fit together so damn well. But, not in this lifetime I guess...",0,,,
"The only thing that's really kept me alive is the realization that I am alive in order to make everyone around me better than what I am myself and to live for them instead of myself. My life continued for others, never myself. Yesterday my father explained to me how much I've affected people - in this moment I was faced with the truth I put off for more than 11 years. Being alive hurts people - financially, emotionally and physically. The only reason I am alive has been conflicted - this is when I realized I was fucked.

"It's like cancer. ""You've got 4 months to live."" But sometimes for some reason you outlive their prognosis. ""You've lived for 3 months more!"" It's like suicide. You choose a week. Or you think this week will be the last one. And surprisingly, when THE day comes...it goes just as it comes and you are still breathing. When do you know it's time? Well, I've been spinning in circles for a while now. Round and round and round. Joy, sadness. Over and over and over again. In my dream world, I would be happy, not angry, not sad. I would finally be able to evolve into the woman I envision myself as instead of constantly grabbing her by the cuff of her sleeve. And I would finally publish my book, and be confident in the story. Maybe even sing some songs and feel confident about it. Have a guy who will love me and cherish me. Not control me, not contact me only when he wants something, not judging me and calling me chubby. Be able to be worthy enough for the attention of this one guy in my school. I always see him. Always. But he just doesn't see me. I guess that's how it's supposed to be. With a guy who looks like an Abercrombie Fitch model and a girl who looks like she sells tomatoes for a living. A guy who has nearly a thousand followers on Instagram and a girl who just has 400. Funny isn't it? Or friends who don't constantly make death jokes with me. ""I should get your head tattooed with a noose around your neck"". Thanks, best friend.",0,,,

"When daydreaming my mind brings up negative memories. In any situation, in any location my mind will simply wander and bring up pessimistic memories instantly. I'll often be left pondering ""why did I do that?"" - ""why did I say that?"". These will often be memories or sort of quick snapshots of uneasy moments in my life that will flash through my psyche as soon as I have a spare moment. It's happened on the train, when at work and socialising with friends. The odd thing is that the memories vary in date - it could be something I said last week, to something I did at a party when I was like five years old. The underlying factor is that all of these memories will have negative associations and will leave me questioning my actions, thoughts and responses at the time. It seems as though I have no control over what memories or images appear - I have been overheard saying ""How can I even remember that!"" when peculiar or seemingly distant images re-appear. Does anyone else have any similar experiences with this? And apologies if this is not the correct Reddit for this post.",0,,,

I have several passions such as writting, video games, and cars. Butbi am not good at any of these things so it just ultimately seems ridiculous. I feel bad for my wife because I am extremely bad at expressing any emotion and mostly just hang out somewhere in the middle instead of being excited or supportive. I've felt like I'm a bit off for a long time but I have avoided seeking any help out of shame or fear. My job won't allow for me to seek mental help without transferring me and I've always been rather prideful.

Nothing can keep it from happening except ending it all before it gets to that point. I keep thinking ‚ÄòWell, I could try and off myself, that would keep things interesting and I could put off that fate for just a little longer.‚Äô But no. Eventually I‚Äôll settle down into a meaningless, soul sucking job, just like everyone else, and wait patiently for death like a good boy.",0,,,

"I can't really remember exactly the last time I didn't want to kill myself. The feeling has always been there but I didn't really acknowledge it until about early high school. I can say with pretty good confidence that I've wanted to kill myself everyday since then. Reading many posts about what people have been through and their current awful situations just makes me feel more guilty for being suicidal even though I have a caring family and am decently well off. My birthday is on new years. I was born just past midnight, so my family and I usually celebrate it on New Year's Eve. However, the last few birthdays I haven't been happy. I always work for my parent's business because we're constantly understaffed. I don't have freedom. I just work. On top of that, I have to deal with the constant desire to just die while having to work. Every year, I'm scared of what the new year will bring, and I resent my parents just a little more for letting me become the happy little accident that I am now. Couldn't they just use a condom? 2016 has been one giant clown fiesta for me. I'm fully confident that 2017 will be just as bad. I want to make it all end now but I'm too scared of the pain and the nothingness that will consume me once I'm gone. I'm not religious so I don't believe in an after life.

I started having social anxiety problems around this time as well. Most of my friends started experimenting with drugs and alcohol, but I knew that wasn't for me. Still my social anxiety made me think that because I was different than them in that way, they wouldn't like me as much. I was also scared they'd pressure me into doing it with them. So I started to socially isolate myself. I'm in college now, and I really don't talk to anyone besides my family. I have two people I talk to at my job, but we don't hang out outside of work. I've learned how to keep myself entertained, but now I long for companionship. I still sometimes struggle with my social anxiety and am afraid of putting myself out there only to push people away like I did before. Also I'm kinda shy so it's hard to talk to people lol. Anyone else out there a loner feeling a little lonesome? I'm new to redditt, so I'm hoping I did this right. Take care everyone.",0,,,
"Where do I start? I just don't enjoy anything anymore. I have a lot and none of it matters because everything pisses me off and I don't relate to people.

"I was sitting in my room just trying to deal with life, and all the shit that has been thrown at me in the last few years when out of nowhere there was this flash of memory, and I remembered that this isn't the first time things have been bad, and that things have actually been far, far worse. And I remembered that all those years ago, music was life. For a brief moment, I remembered what it was like to feel. For real music, honest music, you have to be able to feel. I remembered that I would drift through the day back then so numb to the world, but when I got home, plugged up to the amp, and put on my 100 dollar studio quality headphones and magically I could feel. I wanted to remember that, so it's just what I did. Been a *long* time so I had to do some digging, and almost got stuck in the memories held by all the crap in storage, but I found it. The main volume dial needs to be replaced, and I had to rewire the speaker to the amp, but it all still works. And I played. Nothing fancy, just tuning, and some finger exercises, and other ""warmup"" stuff. I can't really remember how to play much else right now, but I did the thing, and it was great. I think I smiled for the first time in weeks.",0,,,
"So, there's this podcaster/YouTuber I stumbled upon, and in one of his recent videos, the topic of suicide comes up. In the video, he speaks about all the suicidal messages he recieves from people all around the world who listen/watch him. As he goes on, it gets harder for him to talk about it, and it reaches the point where he breaks down, where just describing the messages puts him in tears, as you can tell how much he cares for these people and how much he can empathise with them. But, I just don't understand it. As much as I try to get it, I can't. Why do people weep for us? Why do they care so much? Why do they spend so much time and resources helping us get better? And with 7.6 billion other happy souls out there, why should one or two lives even matter? TLDR: I just don't understand why people would help and care for others so much, even when there's nothing in it for them?",0,,,

"I'm an 18 year old with severe depression, anxiety, ADHD, borderline personality disorder and DID at a point in my life. But I'm slowly recovering. I have always felt like I never belonged to this world, because I am ""too imaginative"" and ""too kind"". I behave ""not like how people should"". I'm mostly well-liked, but I know they think I'm a weirdo. Everyone does. It's final exam time for us, and I have to secure good marks, otherwise I won't be able to enter any good streams in a good college. It would be the end of my future. My family is in a financial crunch, but they give up everything for me. I am dead-set on helping my friends get through their depression and suicidal tendencies, but I'm failing at that. I have had three attempts, but I was saved by a person, who himself was alexithymic (I think) and suicidal. He still is, and he says if he doesn't do well, he will commit suicide. I don't know what I'm gonna do if I don't perform the way I should. But I certainly know that I will die if he does. In case everything goes wrong, I'll leave. There's no other way.

I didn‚Äôt want her to either belittle my feelings or freak out. Then one night I got drunk and I can‚Äôt even remember how it got brought up, but I remember ugly crying to my mom about how over the past almost 5 years something has changed with me mentally and I‚Äôve been having suicidal thoughts that have increased with time. I‚Äôve always been depressed feeling and I self harmed when I was a teenager, but it was never like this. I think child birth triggered something because this all started with the intense sadness after having my first son (I‚Äôm assuming it was Postpartum Depression, but I never reached out. I was ashamed.) but the suicidal thoughts have increased over the past year and a half and I feel the shift in the manic and depression phases.

It's becoming difficult not to discuss it with others or bring it up during conversations, especially because it's on my mind 24/7, it's the most remarkable thing that will happen to me probably ever. This probably sounds like an egotistical rant ""I, I, I, me, me, me"", but I do not care, for too long my life has been dictated by other people and factors out of my control and in my last 15 days, I'm gonna fucking focus on myself, nobody and nothing else matters to me now (when have I ever mattered to them?)",0,,,

I've been suicidal in the past and really thought I was better. For some reason started thinking about all the bad/hurtful things I've done to people and within like a week went from feeling generally good to researching ways to kill myself.

And I feel like I would kind of deserve it. I'm scared that even if I make it through this I'm just doomed to being suicidal all my life and eventually I'll be impulsive enough to do it.

"Okay everyone hello there, recently I've been having extreme panic attacks and depression. It all started with me crying imagining what would happen to me if my parents died on public transport. My mum instantly comforted me and told me that wouldn't happen (I'm 13). I continued on to yesterday which as you all know is New year's. I started getting even more panicky thinking about what happens after life and that if I die is that it? I solved that by reading some theories on after life and forming my opinion that we go into a sort of lounge with the spirits who wait for us. After that I've lost all ambition to become an entrepreneur and just thinking of what point is there to life. I've been able to get myself out of the panicky state only when watching youtube or playing video games. Any other time I end up being highly stressed for some unknown reason.

He had already broken up with me 3 months ago saying that his feelings for me were fading away but he already had a plain ticket to come see me for November. 3 days ago he broke up with me saying that he needs to be alone, that he needs to figure things out, that the distance is too hard (We were planning on me moving there in 2 years until he finished university) we already had been through 3 years together, 3 very hard years as well where my father died and I lost my mind to depression and anxiety.

"I'll try to be as transparent as possible without revealing too much. I am a high school senior, about to graduate in \~3 months. It feels like my life has been defined by the pressure to get good grades; and while I have done decently well in that regard, it has come at the expense at my social life and a lot of other things I value. I used to love the sport I played; now it feels like a burden to even show up to practice. I feel the same way about the other extracurricular activities I'm involved in. I've been rejected to several colleges/programs already, some of which I thought I had a decent shot at getting into. Occasionally, I have what I think are real suicidal impulses, but I know that I'm too much of a fucking pussy to do anything about it. The closer and closer I get to graduation, the lower my work ethic stoops, and the worse I feel about the utterly pathetic excuse of a human being that I now am.

"I know for me I came to realize by my late teenage years that I have developed dual brain consciousness. What I mean is I alternate between two states at any given moment. Around friends and family I ""turn on"" my visual hemispheres. I actively look to be creative and funny and this drains my energy. When I'm alone I turn off and operate entirely on unconscious awareness. I will stare at the wall and ""recharge"" No thoughts, no feelings, like a dead man. People who caught me in the ""off mode"" have told me I have dead eyes. All of this translates to my sex life (non existent right now) But when it was active I was never able to cum inside a woman. The reason being sex is a spontaneous act. And i operate like a robot in the off or on mode. I simply can't let go like other people. This is what causes my depression. Could be autism, adhd, or any other host of illnesses. Bottom line is after 25 years I realize you can't change it hard as you try. The neural pathways planted their roots long ago. This causes me pain because all I ever want is to socialize and keep appearances like normal people",0,,,

"https://imgur.com/a/VxDwF So, I was rummaging through my folders to organise them since they're a mess. I found some things - On the left, is a note my mum mailed to me at the start of my first year of Uni as she knows how homesick I was, even though it had only been about 2 weeks since I left home. On the right, is a cute birthday card that my little brother made for me.

My relationship was toxic as it felt as though I was the only one trying as I clinged onto the thoughts that she would be the one who help me to get out of depression. She was initially really supportive and that was why I was attracted to her, she helped me to elavate my abuse of tobacco but I feel as though I'll fall back into that sinkhole. People change and I don't blame her. She feels exhausted and does not feel the same way anymore. Right now I'm just really exhausted of everything.

"A month ago I was feeling suicidal. During that period I had a conversation with my son's 16 year old cousin from his mom's side of the family. During our conversation he mentioned to me how much he cares and looks up to me and how I was the only adult he could talk to about girls, his problems, and guitars (shit all teenage boys like to talk about). After our conversation I started thinking about what he said and about all the people in my life that care/depend on me (my son, parents, friends, etc.). And for some reason it seemed like more of a reason to kill myself. I found comfort in knowing that if I killed myself I would be missed. I knew they would be sad for awhile but eventually they would move on and think about all the good times we had. I liked knowing that despite my decision I would die knowing I had an impact on someones life. Has anyone else felt that way? I've been to my psychiatrist and adjusted my meds and know I'm doing great. I just thought I'd share incase someone can relate.",0,,,

"I have no reason to feel this way.

I haven't really felt 100% for a couple years now, but no one i know has an inkling of what's happening to me, cause i think i hide it quite well with humour and when im socialising, it grants me temporary relief from these feelings of self doubt and loneliness, but always, when im alone these feelings creep back in and i can never seem to be rid of them. I've never really had much luck with relationships, i had something serious a couple months back, which actually stopped my lamenting, but it fizzled out pretty quickly and the feelings returned, and magnified with each failure to communicate with any girl im interested in. And now i sit here by myself, again, watching the fireworks from my window as my family sleeps and with music in my ears, just feeling.. sad. I don't really know how to explain it or why I'm like this, so i figured i may as well share and get outside opinions on it.

"For my most of my life I wanted to be a musician. My best friend and I were in a band together and we were building something. However, as I entered my mid-20s and entered a serious relationship, I felt competing priorities and wanted to potentially pursue career paths that had more stability and less time away for things like touring. Since then, I've been locked in paralysis for over a year about I should be doing with my life. I feel a lot of regret about leaving the music path, yet don't feel confident enough to rejoin it either. Similarly, I feel hopeless attempting to commit myself to another path that will make me fulfilled. The more I think about things and analyze them, the more my brain takes me down a dangerous path of regret, anxiety, and despair.

"New Year's Day. What a way to start the year, right? I've spent the last few weeks, maybe months feeling worthless and sad and wanting to die but not wanting to kill myself, so I fantasized about getting into an accident and dying in a way that looked like it wasn't on my own hands. I got out of the car with just some whiplash and some bruises but I'm fine otherwise. It's a miracle I'm alive right now. I spun out on the freeway going 75 mph. I got hit by another car. The witnesses and patrol officer and the EMT all expected me to be unconscious or way more badly hurt than I was. I don't believe in God, but I do think there was a greater force at work, telling me to stop fantasizing about something so horrible and to get my shit together. So I'm going to. Phone calls give me anxiety, I know I'm going to have a bout of PTSD related to driving, I'm going to feel guilty about wrecking my parents' car, but I'm okay. Everything is okay.

Recently since I don't sleep much and I have a lot of down time to myself I consume myself in my thoughts.

"The next sorry excuse for a piece of shit that says that suicide is a ""permanent solution to a temporary problem"" might just get taken along with me.

Problems I have no solutions for and have run dry on ideas. I can't help but think of wartime. If everything you know of the enemy is that they have no mercy, that they are ruthless, and that they will do nothing but torture you, and you find yourself surrounded by them, history shows us that people in such a situation would often choose to take their own life rather than suffer such a fate. Back to us, today. A permanent solution to all of my problems sounds pretty fucking nice.

Here is my reasoning behind this feeling, most people I know or have met when I was smaller said I was really charismatic, outgoing, etc but that I changed all of a sudden what I can guess was when I was around 6-7 based in the few memories I have. I became serious with out any sign of change and now I don't care about anything, but mean absolutely anything it is what can only be described as ""detached"". It could have been from suppression of who I am since that age because of people having expectations for me resulting in me not developing any real hobbies/interests and knowing how to express my likes/dislikes or due to some other events that led me to suppress myself.

"I went to a club with pretty good DJs last night. I went there last year as well and enjoyed it. Last night though at first I was fine and everything was cool but it got to just after midnight and I got this overwhelming feeling that I should leave.

My mood had slightly picked up before we went out but once we were there I just couldn't escape what I was feeling. My girlfriend was naturally really upset and couldn't understand why I wanted to leave. After having a bit of a row I just yelled ""It's because I'm fucking depressed!"" and left by myself. I have feelings of guilt - obviously I know she wanted me there but I let this mood I'm having control what I do. It must have looked strange to everyone and I feel like I wasted the night and an opportunity to have fun.

All the shit in my life, the pain, the abuse, the rape...I don't even know if that's what hurts or if it's just the existential dread that I am nothing and am useless. I don't know if finishing grad school will even make me happy, because how could I ever be happy? I keep searching for meaning or being able to feel SOMETHING, literally anything but this blah-ness that encompasses everything I do. I drink, I go out, I go on rollar coasters, I run away for a month and nothing changes. Everything still feels like nothing. I'm empty. The only time I feel alive is when I'm playing video games because then I'm not me, I'm doing something totally abnormal. But my life is meaningless. There is not light, no happiness. I get brief glimpses of that feeling I don't even remember when my bf hugs me or shows he cares in some small way but overwhelmingly I'm just...empty. And it's isolating to feel like this. I feel so alone. He tries to understand but he doesn't live in my head, he can't know. I appreciate that he tries but I still feel overwhelmingly alone.",1,"pain, abuse, rape, isolating, alone", existential dread that I am nothing and am useless,

"After being tossed aside by a few people now that I considered really close to me, it has me wondering if it‚Äôs even worth meeting new people.

I don‚Äôt want to start over again telling people about myself, telling stories, explaining how I think, and all of those things you naturally do when you know someone for years.

I don't want to burden everyone with my depression and be the one that people avoid because I'm always miserable and low. I'm anxious all the time and don't know how to control this, anxious about the smallest things that other people do each day with ease.

"I always liked beauty. Probably the only thing that kept me from ending it all. But even it wasn't enough, isn't, most of the time. Sometimes the only thing that calms me is to plan how I'm going to do it. It came to a point that every time that I'm suicidal again the only thing stopping me is the complexity of the scene. I still don't have the right things, I can't go to the place, my hair isn't in the right length and etc. I never told anyone about it. I'm living between numbness and intense feelings that hurt too much. I feel like I'm wasting my privileges, I'm wasting my capacities, I don't want to, I don't know what to do. The best phases are when I'm hyper, but I get destructive and it's not ideal. I miss xanax but I'm tired of numbing it down. I'm tired of living like a nun, I'm tired of always having to control myself so much when I feel something. And I ask myself what is going to happen the day I have everything ready. Sometimes I wish it was today. Sometimes I just don't want to think about it. If someone knows a way out of this, I can listen. I'm always listening anyway.",0,,,

"Every single moment of my life lately has been absolute torture, and filled with mental anguish. There is not many things i'd rather do at the moment besides kill myself. The problem is that I can't for one major reason. It would completely destroy my dad, and might kill him in the process too. My father and I have a special bond that you don't find with many people nowadays; we aren't just family, we are best friends. My father is the only person I can really speak my mind to, and he has said that I am his only true friend. My father has been through some dark places lately, too. It feels like the universe won't let him keep anything good for too long. He's lost about 5 jobs over the past month, through no fault of his own. My mother and the love of his life said no to his marriage proposal and left him. His parents give him 0 encouragement for anything. I won't go into any more detail about him as I'm afraid he'll find this post by some luck, and the fact that I've been rambling. The point is that if I kill myself, that would just be one more layer on top of the shit sandwich he's had to slowly eat. Sorry for the rant, I just needed to tell somebody about this, as it's been eating me from the inside out. Does anybody have a similar experience they want to get off of their chest?",0,,,
"I recently opened up to a family member that I take 2 medications for my depression (and for anxiety &amp; PTSD), and I have trouble explaining how they work for me, and how I feel/think/am with and without them.

"I used to be concerned with my image too, until once I came up with a little thought experiment. Imagine that you live in a world where you look to others the way you feel, and depending on how good you feel inside how good you appear to others. This is kind of real for hormones and these produce pheromones. Anyone can feel a certain way within, and this has a direct impact in others. Not only that, but the fact that most of the time you are not looking at yourself, the only thing you percieve of yourself is how you feel, so focus on just that. &amp;#x200B; We live in a world where everyone is self conscious, so never think people are observing you more than that people are just focused on how the world percieves them, just what happens to you, so come out of that mental trancestate and be one of the few people that can burst out of that bubble.",0,,,

I feel like I‚Äôm not even a functioning human at this point. The amount of effort needed to simply get out of bed or do my homework unbearable. This is the first time where I have been able to see the physical effects of my depression just looking at myself in the mirror.

I‚Äôve never told anyone I‚Äôm depressed and I just kinda be the funny one at school or with my friends. I‚Äôve never gone to a doctor or psychologist or anything about my depression but I think I may be bipolar. I do (or did) go to a psychologist for ADHD and they said when I was like 10 I might be at risk for developing bipolar disorder. But that was that I‚Äôm 14 now and that‚Äôs my theory.

"I thought I escaped the depression. From the first dose of my Spiro and Estrogen I felt a huge weight off of my shoulders. It was time to be myself and thrive. I enjoyed it. I no longer needed to hide. After a couple of months I thought I'd try dating. Of course, I expected the hate messages. I expected the slurs. What I never expected was the amount of men that maintained interest after I disclosed that I'm transgender. What I soon found was a pattern. A pattern I could not escape. It was in this moment I realized what being a living fetish is like. For the past nine months I've been nothing more to men than a source for pictures and a discreet fun time. I still fall for the player saying he wants something more than hooking up just to be used, ghosted, and hit up when he is drunk and horny. The first few times hurt my ego but I recovered. Having the same story for nine months straight makes me question if this is all that life has for me. I want nothing more than to just connect with someone. Talk with a guy about life and get to know each other. But. The only attention I ever get are if I post naughty pics or nudes. Once I show and indication that I'm human they ghost. I've made a few trans friends and the story is the same. Doesn't matter how pretty. How much they pass. We're just a fetish and nothing more. It makes sense why they're all either depressed or escorts. I've fought the desire to end it completely so I no longer have to deal with the loneliness. It's a crippling loneliness. I'll never find love.",0,,,
"Today I finally got the strength to finally get help with my depression. Still trying to figure out the logistics of when my first appointment will be with the doctor but I‚Äôm proud I am taking a step in the right direction. I think my slide into depression the last 6 months is from the loss of my dad as well as some other personal issues (hated my job/fallout with some friends/bad breakup) but it took 6+ months after all that for me to finally realize I needed help. I was sleeping in, just watching tv/playing Xbox and avoiding my friends at times when I started to feel anxious. I started becoming more and more of a recluse but at this point I‚Äôm done with this feeling. I have gotten a new job and mentioned to my boss that I might need to show up an hour late on Fridays for my therapy. She couldn‚Äôt have been more understanding and supportive of it. I was nervous as hell to tell her but glad I did (depression hasn‚Äôt effected my work, in a weird way it‚Äôs the one part of my life I have felt empowered/productive).

Every time I talk to one of my friends, they tell me about their days stuffed full of classes and going out and traveling and somehow still fitting in basic care of themselves and their homes. They talk about living their best lives, and how they are in their prime. I feel like I am talking to a completely different species. It takes an incredible amount of mental willpower to get myself out of bed in the morning and feed myself.

So my thoughts are just gonna be thrown out there so without further ado.... I think I suck. At everything...my job, having friends, just...everything really. It honestly feels like I cannot just work like a human being. Now don't get me wrong, i don't hate life. I have things I rather love about life such as my family and my job including the people I work with. And everyone keeps telling me how ""nice"" and ""good"" I am at my job such as winning a rather ""employee of the month"" sorta thing but as strange as this seems.... I struggle to believe them. Now of course I'm not calling them liars I just find it to hard to believe. I know that sounds rather stupid but I honestly just can't help feel this way. As I said I truly love my job and everyone there but that is honestly where most of my self esteem comes from so constantly thinking I'm horrible at it is obviously not a good cycle. Now as for everything else apart from my job, well I will just break it down like this: I'm at overweight, ugly, shy, embarssing and awkward guy that honestly anyone could cringe at talking to. And of course I'm trying to overcome some of these things like the overweight part but...I'm honestly losing hope at this point and it's giving thoughts of doing something silly to my self.

"33,m. I went through a very hard and life changing break up last year. Currently I live with a friend. I make decent money, I have lots saved up, I have lots of hobbies and interests. I've been told I'm a pretty good looking guy. I've had a few women over the last year, but only one really stuck out. I met this woman over a month ago and we kicked it off really quickly. I developed feelings for her, but she just completely flaked out one day about 3 weeks ago (I'm presuming she met another guy). I have no idea why this is affecting me so much, but I feel really depressed about it. I'm having troubles sleeping, I'm having crazy anxiety. The other day I had my first anxiety attack, actually. I'm starting to feel very hollow. I feel like this isn't normal considering I only knew this woman for 2.5 weeks, but I just can't seem to shake this funk I'm in. What is going on here? Is this normal? Does anyone have any suggestions on how to get out of this funk?",0,,,

I have never been happy and content in my life, severe depression that's been on for 4+ years is one of the root causes. Depressed because I have no intimate interactions with females, who I am absolutely attracted to. Three ago I started experiencing thoughts that I would truly find happiness if I were born a female and I don't really know how I find solute in that thought - maybe because of my limited experience with women, but I do not know for sure. I lost my virginity after two days of my 18th birthday to a hooker and I didn't even get to finish. I've only hooked up with one girl when I was 17 and that included only making out and that was it, apart from those two experiences I have other sexual experience whatsoever.

"Part of me wants to go to a big NYE party/event tonight, because that's what normal people do on new years - right? I would spend a bunch of money on taxis, booze, event tickets etc.. all to be *normal*. That's what I usually do, but I'm not in the mood for it this year.. It all feels so pointless to me now. Sure, it'll be depressing knowing that everyone else will be out tonight having fun, but it's all so superficial; get drunk, yell happy near years, feel like crap in the morning and resume regular life the next day. No matter what I chose to do I'll still be depressed. I don't want to celebrate with strangers, but I also don't want to be alone tonight..",0,,,
"I have always wanted to learn to draw and play guitar, I have a lot of fun when I mess around with that kind of stuff too.

I keep feeling like dying so I stop doing what I want to do, so even if I end up living when it comes to stuff I care about I'm not any better. Right now I want to practice my drawing, I'm not very good at it but I really enjoy it and I'd love to be a skilled artist one day. But right now I have plans to kill myself on February 1st. I'm going to lock myself in my bathroom and just start taking pills until something happens. I haven't completely given up or anything like that, I'm putting my last bit of energy into this last month of my life, I'm doing everything I can to get help, but this is it. If I'm not able to get help or at least some real faith that help is on the way then I'm done. So even if I enjoy drawing it seems like a huge waste to practice if I'm just going to die anyway. I don't have enough time to gain any real skill.",0,,,

I drove him away and now it feels like we dont know each other. all our conversations are one sided. I haven't seen him for weeks except for the two times I asked to talk to him.

"So I just talked to my parents today for the first time regarding that I want to get therapy. I just have a few questions (they may be hard to answer, so bare with me, I just want to know what to expect): 1) idk if this makes sense, but some of my typical depressive thoughts seem to not be as accessible when i'm in a better (not happy though) mood. this makes it harder to talk about the underlying issues. could this be a potential problem? 2) what do they typically ask you on the first appointment? 3) if i've been really narrow-minded and close-minded to a lot of people around me trying to tell me to think more positive and eat more, etc., is therapy really best for me? would therapy be helping me become less stubborn and more open-minded? 4) for those who have gone through therapy, was it relieving to finally have the official diagnosis? 5) again, for those who have gone through/are going through therapy, what's the biggest change you've seen in yourself? it can be good or bad. thanks in advance!",0,,,

"I don't really want to die, or rather I don't have any reason to and I want to not want to die, but I still know that probably in the next 5-10 years I'll just do it. I won't make some long post here, I won't call for help or show any major signs, I probably won't even give/have a good reason, I just know that one day I'm going to wake up and go throughout my day like normal, and then just jump off the roof or hang myself or something.

I can see how people can just go crazy and seemingly snap and start killing people or hijack a bus or start just running around naked or something, and if anything I'm lucky enough to know that I have no urge to harm others and would do anything to save someone that isn't myself, but I just feel the need to off myself and I know that eventually it'll just happen. Lately I've noticed myself getting into a lot more dangerous situations I think maybe because I feel a need to have control over my own death, and that getting in random fights with junkies on the subway and getting hit by cars when chasing the bus excites me because my life (or death) isn't in my control. I don't know maybe I'm the only one that feels this way but I wanted to see if anyone else had any similar experiences or tips with how to feel less trapped by my own depression.",0,,,

"I'm not sure this is the right subreddit but I need some outside opinions. Some backstory: I'm currently attending college. I have a body focused repetitive disorder that popped up around early high school and has since been a lot better. I've always been a bit on the depressed side since middle school with low self esteem. One reccuring thing is in certain situations I become very stressed (?) to the point where my mind just digs itself into a hole of despair and I have episodes of just crying and feeling extremely awful. Most recently, I've been triggered by my boyfriend. At first it was just arguments over random things we disagreed on and slowly the crying episodes came on. Eventually I think it's just instances of him being mad at things I don't do on purpose but are sometimes wrong and me feeling so bad about myself that I get into that mind space and can't get out. He thinks of them as tantrums and doesn't know how to deal with or help with them. Even at home, when I think too much I focus on all the bad and this happens again. I start doubting my relationship because of all the bad stuff, I start feeling bad about my life etc. For the most part I really like my relationship. Outside of the arguments we fit together really well. He's very sweet and caring.

"I'm getting really bad grades in a class I used to be really good at. And in another class I'm being really disorganized losing sheets and not getting homework done on time. Truth is, Im exhausted from the moment I wake up so I'll just sleep when i get home, or I'll need to distract myself with a low effort activity rather than concentrate on homework to calm myself down from wanting to hurt myself. But I'm just lazy right? It's so frustrating being seen as careless when I'm just trying to survive. But my teachers expect me to get over myself because everyone goes through hard times. I'm already seeing a school counsellor who's not helping in any way and it's in secret because my parents wont let me see a proper therapist. Yesterday when I got 2 essays back I got E on both of them and I just wanted to tear my hair out because I'm trying so hard to balance everything out but it's not good enough. Seriously, all I can think about is killing myself and it's good enough that I actually come into school when I dont want anyone to see me because I feel too ugly, and I try to socialise with people and not zone out in class for like 8 hours. I just want everyone to know I have depression and help me out in any way but no. They dont give a shit. So I'll just fail and theyll never know why.",0,,,

"I don't see how it's supposed to help me feel or think any better. I already know that the way I think about things causes me to be depressed, but somehow I'm okay with it. It's difficult to explain. I AM my thoughts, and my thoughts aren't irrational. I'm not depressed because my ""brain is lying to me"". Why do I sit around not doing anything? Because at my core, I don't feel an intrinsic desire to actually do something that doesn't bring me immediate physical pleasure. I don't reap the intangible rewards of completing goals or learning new things. I just don't care for it. That's a fact. I guess you could chalk me up to a whining child since I clearly don't want to push myself out of the mental rut, and with that I would agree. My values don't exist anymore. I'm a shell of a person and I don't care enough to change that. That's the thing everyone who wants to help just doesn't understand. They can't help me due to philosophical reasons. There's not a thing anyone could tell me that would make me feel as if anything mattered. There's not a thing I could tell myself to change that either. I could mechanically flip the switch on that thought so to speak, but I wouldn't FEEL it. Going with it trying to fake it till I DO feel it doesn't work because it's not GENUINE. That's the thing about major depression. It is a rational reaction and it is a genuine reaction. When someone comes out of it, they don't become ""themselves"" again; they were always themselves. They were able to flip the switch and FEEL it. This, I cannot do, and not because I think I can't.",0,,,

What do you do after 7 years of trying to make it better? I started working out, stopped smoking, got help with ADD. none of it has helped. I thought bettering yourself was suppsoed to help?

"I am currently in my friend's restroom breaking down for the last ~30 minutes. Aplogies for the wall of text. In the eyes of many, I am sure my life is fine. I am moderately attractive with a relatively outgoing personality and decent intelligence. I get lucky with some thing and have the best friend group someone could ask for. Yet despite all this, I still am overwhelemed with depression. To preface, my depression is sometimes caused by outlying causes, but mostly seems to manifest randomly whenever it wants to. I graduated in 2010 with high expectations from my folks. Nothing too crazy, but significantly better than I performed. With depression and anxiety, I have skipped on many of the opportunities in life (fun, women, careers, etc) and can't seem to truly overcome it entirely. I trick myself into believing it is gone for periods of time, but it inevitably comes back harder than the times previous. I now am sitting in 2018 having accomplished little outside of making a good friend group, and while having gone into business with a close friend, feel like I am the weak partner. Ultimately my whole life feels like I squandered it and wasted myself when others could've capitalized and lived a happy, fruitful life while my depression and anxiety rules who I am to this day. Frankly, I don't feel deserving of the opportunities I have recieved, regardless of any good I have done. I know it's stupid for someone in my situation to feel this way with so much good in life compared to most others in this subreddit and elsewhere, so i'm sorry. Hope you all have a good year.",1,"depression, anxiety, skipped on many of the opportunities","moderately attractive, feel like I am the weak partner, don't feel deserving of the opportunities",

"A few months ago (possibly more, my perception of time isn't great right now) my best friend started having seizures, and a tumour was discovered in his brain. Since then he's been through various rounds of radio and chemotherapy, and today had the results back from a recent scan. The tumour has reduced massively in size, and the parts they were really concerned with appear to be gone. This is brilliant news! And while I feel a sense of relief, and am no longer fixated on ""what if it's terminal?"", I just can't seem to feel any positivity. I don't want this to have an impact on our relationship, but I feel like I'm withdrawing and slipping away from him. We used to live together, but he's back living with his parents (since before the tumour) due to other issues. I'm trying to be there for him, but between work and constantly feeling like shit, I feel like I'm letting him down. I don't know whether I'm asking for advice or just ranting.

I was one of the only upper classmen who was really into stuff like anime and video games, so all the younger nerds sort of looked up to me? I guess? I was the drum major in my schools band, and I had all this other stuff going on. My senior year of highschool was the year I grabbed life by the balls and made it my bitch. But now look at me, I can't even muster the energy to get out of bed. I can't hold a job, I can't drive, my girlfriend left me, etc. I'm not half the person I was just a year ago.

"Organizing my thoughts enough to make this make sense is difficult. I have a bad habit of trying to smoke and work my time away, because on the clock is the only time that I'm not exhausted and angry. Neither of my two current jobs keep me busy enough, so I've started searching for a third. I've stopped smoking weed for the search, and now the depression is deepening again. The smallest things make me want to rage endlessly, destroying everything around me, but I don't even have the energy to waste on being angry. I've never let myself consider suicide or self harm, so I'm stuck in a shitty nihilistic spiral of hating to live and living to hate.

"I was taking 40mg Celexa for Anxiety disorder. It wasn't working so well so my Psychiatrist put me on Effexor. Here was his tapering off plan: 1st week: 30mg Celexa &amp; 37.5 Effexor 2nd &amp; 3rd week: 20mg Celexa &amp; 75mg effexor 4th week: 10mg Celexa &amp; 150mg Effexor 5th week: Psychiatrist appointment Now, i'm on week 3 taking 20mg Celexa &amp; 75mg Effexor and i'm starting to get very depressed. I am not having suicidal thoughts and if i did i would go straight to the ER. But i am having depression. So my question is, should i keep on pushing through ? Go back to 30mg Celexa &amp; 37.5mg Effexor ? Start 10mg Celexa (Maybe stay on 20mg) &amp; 150mg Effexor a couple days early to get a higher dose of Effexor in my system ? It's strange because my anxiety hasn't been bad since starting. The reason i'm asking here is that my psychiatrist is on holidays and i dont see him until mid January. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks",0,,,
Natural causes: after wanting to die for an entire lifetime,0,,,
I really am having a hard time with life. Nothing in my life seems worth achieving or working for. I'm emotionally filled with self hatred to the point where I just want to end it all. I harm myself fairly often and it does little to quell my disgust in myself. I am barely holding on. I would have done it earlier but I couldn't find any blades.,1,,"emotionally filled with self hatred, my disgust in myself","want to end it all, harm myself "
"So depression sucks, it really does. The internal fighting of oneself, I‚Äôm just wanting it to stop. I‚Äôm not suicidal (this time) but other times it gets the better of me. This is the most candid I‚Äôve ever been. I use to type long monologues into the google search bar of how I would like life to end, that would be the closest I come to speaking about my internal sadness. I would delete it along with my search history as I would hate for someone to view it and be concerned. This is a ‚Äúthrowaway‚Äù account I guess, but my reason for posting is not to say I‚Äôm sick and about to end it, but I‚Äôm hoping there are ways to help it. I can‚Äôt do this ‚Äòtrain your brain‚Äô crap or self help books. I‚Äôve had numerous meds but lose sense of who I am. Is there a physical therapy, shock, sleep etc etc that can jolt you out of this mental rut? I have my vision on psychedelic therapies, those look promising. Any other possible helps?",0,,,

I feel bad about decisions I make, feelings I have, the place I am in life. I want someone to talk to and tell me I'm not a fuck up, but I don't want to admit things to people I know. I have a wonderful girlfriend, who is understanding and kind and non judgmental, but I don't know what to say to her, or anyone really.

"For years, I have battled depression. I have battled suicidal ideations. I thought to myself, hospitalization and IOP would do the trick. Would get me out of this state.

I don't care about my job, I am barely hanging on to my life in general. I am losing friends by the minute. Why the fuck does my life even matter?

"2017 was rough. My brain fell into cycles of self degradation way too easily, this led me down a spiral this year which made me end a long relationship, lose some friends, and made me put duties that would have helped me to the wayside like taking my dog out. The past few months leading to now has been anti social to say the least. I stopped trying to make plans with friends as I was tired of hearing no, my friends clearly didn't want me around a whole lot (since September I had a total of 2 outings with friends, pre September we spent probably too much time together at ~6 days a week). On top of that another good friend of mine moved away indefinitely. 2017 I realized I can't rely on my friends the way I thought I could, I wish I could but life doesn't work like that. My New Years resolution this year is to not base my happiness and social success around if my friends and I are having fun. I've realized I don't need my friends to go play an open Mic night, or go see a movie, or to go for a hike, in fact a lot of these are better done alone. 2017 my friends left me high and dry 2018 they're not gonna be able to",0,,,

I'm so tired of people getting bored of me, sometimes it takes a week, sometimes a month, sometimes a year. Eventually everyone gets bored (and the few who aren't bored of me, they are always so busy). Don't get me wrong, I do have a bunch of brilliant friends, who are fantastic to hang out with. I do genuinely believe they enjoy my company, but when I'm down and want to talk to them they don't want to know. They push me away when I need them most. I really want a long hug, not just a quick one to say hello or goodbye. Even better to snuggle up in front of a movie with someone and just for an hour or so feel embraced and less broken. And yet I constantly feel detached from all of this, I get moments where I feel like I am inside this body but not connected to it. I feel distant from all those around me. Then theres the confidence issue, I've always had some problems with confidence. Sure I'm great at being outwardly confident should I be at work sorting problems out, or in charge of a bunch of people whist running an event. I can take the lead when I have to.

"Hi, I'm in my senior year in high school, and I need help with my girlfriend. While I currently do not have depression, she does. One thing that worries me the most is her pessimism. Sometimes, there will be a situation that she is not looking forward to (for example, she is getting her wisdom teeth out tomorrow), and she gets incredibly down and grumpy about the situation. I have told her that it will be ok and that I'm here for her, but she continues to rebut with ""I'm being logical and I'm correct that it will suck"". How do I help her? Obviously she is right and it will suck (I've gotten my wisdom teeth out so I'm definitely aware of the pain), but she still gets really depressed and pessimistic about everything. What do I say? I've already introduced the idea of therapy and she definitely did not like that, so as of now, I'm at a loss as to what to do. Any help is appreciated. Thanks.

The problem with that is that the people like me who only ever get rejected feel even more like shit and don't want to put themselves up to that repeatedly. I'm sure there are others that I have grown tired of hearing, but I can't think of them at the moment. Basically, does anyone have any actually helpful advice for someone who is struggling with finding love?",1,Rejection ,"I don't love me, I despise me",
"I go to a small school, normally no more than 20 students are in a classroom, yet my teachers don‚Äôt even realize I‚Äôm in their class most of the time.

"I'll try keep it brief. My younger sister and I have a good relationship, but she's never really talked to me about depression and her apparent anxiety. I recently got to know she's weekly been visiting the nurse practitioner at her school, and she called our family the other day. My sister apparently has struggled a long time with anxiety, and there's some talk about suicidal thoughts as well. I got to know this through my mom just now. I've read through the talking tips under this sub, but I'm unsure how to deal with this. I have been good at lone-wolfing myself, and never really been depressed, but I'm a good listener.

"I was first diagnosed as depression then later, bipolar. But I had this problem ever since I started to take the meds. I try SO hard to maintain the so called ‚Äúhappy‚Äù mood. I just try so hard to keep my depressions down below the surface so I don‚Äôt effect others around me. But whenever someone ruins my mood, I get uncontrollably mad and I begin to yell at them things I would never say to them. I get strong urge to throw stuff or hit that person but I know that‚Äôs wrong in the inside so I try to keep that under control. What I can‚Äôt control is yelling and cursing. I just get so mad at the fact that they have ruined my mood, which I have been trying so hard to maintain. Maybe I‚Äôm just tired of everything. Honestly I am sick of changing my meds to find the ‚Äúright‚Äù one and the side effects are killing me. I am seriously lacking memories and verbal skills and that stresses me out greatly. I am sick of depression and I hate myself for not being who I am before I was diagnosed. What‚Äôs wrong with me? Is this real me? I would never curse at someone or yell at them, but now look at me full of anger and madness. I just want to end my life seriously.

"Its January 2nd I woke up feeling OK. Thats how it is everyday. I wake up just ""ok"". Thats how my depression is..Its always in the core of my body, but I muster up all the energy I have within to try and act how I'm ""supposed"" to act: Social, happy, positive, hard working. Today I feel as if I can't muster up that energy. I feel like if I go outside today and put on that show that I put on everyday, I might break down. It is effecting my work. I can't tell you how many times I have called out for being ""sick"" I feel like I need time off to get on medication and see a therapist regular to talk through these times. Has anyone else had to deal with depression and needing time off of work? Should I just explain to my manager exactly what is going on? He knows I get into depressive episodes like this and has been sympathetic before. I enjoy my job I just mentally feel depleted right now.

"It was not to long ago until I realised how lonely I am. I hang out with same 4 friends every time who I'm not comfortable with sharing anything because they are immature and make fun out of every little thing their is. Girls don't want to hang out with me because I'm not a typical douchebag like almost everyone. I would ask them out just so we could chat, but that isn't working out. With that being all said I developed this ""someone"" with who I talk to. Coming from a religious family I have grown up to believe in God, so I think I relate this someone with God. I tell all my problems and I request they would go away. My problems only got worse and worse so one night when I was on the edge of breaking down I realised I'm actually talking to no one but myself. When I actually came to this conclusion I fucking broke down pretty hard. Tears were running down my face and all I could think about is how much of a baby I am. I started hitting myself so it would go away. When I started to physically hurt myself I told myself it's enough, go get some help. I know the internet isn't the best place to be around in a situation like this, but there is still enough hope left in me for me to believe there is someone who can relate to me. These are all new stuff I'm experiencing since I never had problems like this. Sorry for the long post, but I actually think I'm going mental.",0,,,

Instead of being sad about my problems I laugh them off and ignore them leaving them there, instead of being too open with my friends driving them away I now have serious problems not being able to express that I care about people. It‚Äôs to the point that apparently (someone else pointed this out) I physically shake when I begin talking about anything wrong with myself. I‚Äôm so fucking sick of this you‚Äôd think of after 4 YEARS of consistently fighting and trying everything (medicine, mediation, therapy) NOTHING has been accomplished.

And I just got hit with this realization last night that there's literally nothing I can do. I can be supportive but aside from that, I can't say or do anything to change his mind.

Been dealing with this bullshit called depression for 12 years now, and I'm only 23. Haha. I hate how I can't deal with stress well; had a serious panic attack on the train yesterday. I don't have anymore friends irl, basically dumped all real life friends because I'm sick of being ""the one that people goes to just because they have no one else, and dumps me the instant they find company"", and basically judgemental friends in general. I only have some online friends who keep me alive. I'm basically almost dead inside. Yesterday, I was talking to a new online acquaintance i met. He kept telling to me to change, he kept forcing his ideals on me. Yeah, if it was that easy to change the neurological pathways in my brain, I would have done so a long time ago. It doesn't make it easy that irl I have so many factors making me feel so damn stressed all the time. I'm sick of people telling me ""you should think positive"", ""It'll get better"". It never does.

And probably what pisses me off the most is the fact she's right bc her and I both know time doesn't wait for anyone. I don't have the luxury to keep performing at the level I'm currently am.

"Let me start off by saying that I wasn't always this way. I used to be an advanced student in elementary school and had a passion for reading and learning; I could absorb knowledge and I had a social life. Then, things took a drastic change in 5th grade for no obvious reason. I suddenly felt tired all the time; as if I didn't sleep enough. All I could think was ""why am I so tired? I'll sleep more tonight"" every day. For the first time in my life, I failed a test. I broke down in tears in the middle of class and was surrounded in anxiety and depression. I also somehow ""obtained"" adhd/extreme forgetfulness and started losing my ability to properly comprehend people speaking to me and use my mind's eye to visualize anything... I was uninhibited in many social situations (my best friend's mom thought I was using drugs before I even knew what a marijuana was) and extremely anxious in others. Stimulants didn't help much besides giving me energy and although anti-depressants help with my mood, all the other symptoms remain. I have a feeling that this is a brain tumor or brain damage because of how it affects me so broadly. I've never had suicidal thoughts and honestly, I don't think too much at all. Nothing crisp, anyways. I'm 19 now and not sure where to proceed from here. My mom believes it's because I became an atheist and my dad thinks it's because I just don't care.

Should I see a neurologist or another specialist?",0,,,

I remember I first called the Samaritans at 116 123 one night because I was feeling suicidal. A kind man named Terry answered the phone and began 'Hello, you've reached the Samaritans - how are you tonight?' 'Um...hello,' I said, 'I'm feeling...uh...pretty suicidal right now.'

"I need help. My mom said that I used to be happy, just for the sake of being happy. I can't even remember when that was. Every time I try to talk about my issues, I end up asking the same questions over and over, borderline asking people to shower me with complements and reminders of my good qualities. My mother is annoyed to no end by this. I don't want to do the same to my friends. As stated in the title, I have lost the will to live. The timing couldn't be worse, as I'm about to start talking classes for my GED, which I will need to talk because I fucked up in high school by being lazy and not doing my homework. I don't necessarily want to commit suicide, but I feel as though I am ""at peace"". I don't care if I'm going to die anymore. Maybe at most I'll shed a tear and ask to say goodbye. But, I am not at peace, for if I were, I wouldn't have such feelings of my own insecurities and self loathing. I don't know what to do to feel better, as every time I am even the slightest bit happy, it always goes away too soon, and I miss that feeling greatly. The biggest worry right now, is my borderline nihilism, the possibility that nothing matters; there is no point. I am unsure at best about whether or not this philosophy is true.

"I talk a lot, fairly flippantly usually, because that's what you do when you've had depression your whole life I guess, about hating myself, but I was just thinking about it, and I don't think I actually do. (This is not a positive post, by the way, this like... gets worse from here, my head is in a super bad place and I really somewhere to vent where no-one irl is gonna see it. Just a warning.) See I think hating or loathing someone takes this huge amount of energy. You have to be conscious about it. I think that's why it's not unusual for someone who really hates them self to also be pretty narcissistic. But for me, it's not a big effort. I don't hate myself, I just.. don't like myself. It's kind of like, when you have a group of friends, and there's one person in the group and you just don't get why anyone likes them. It's not mean-spirited, necessarily, you just don't find them interesting, or funny, or smart. They're not good-looking enough for you to think that that's why people still seem to like them. And you don't think about it all the time, maybe, but it bugs you. You find yourself rolling your eyes when they talk. When they're at events you're like ""seriously? who invited them?"" But when they're not around, you don't even think of them. They don't take up enough of your notice- they aren't remarkable enough- for you to devote any extra thought to.

"Hi so I would like to know what's your opinion on this. So there was an activity at my college, in which students from different schools were coming the univ to see it and explore it. When they came, the college gave them a ticket to get a free meal. We, students of the college itself, are really unhappy with the university because they always have money for anything but the university itself, charging us a lot of money for things that are not there. So we, unleashed, decided to take back what's ours. One guy printed out a lot (maybe like 15-20) tickets of the food and we went there to get the food by ourselves. So at the end of the day, the food was done earlier than usual. We did it only for 2 days out of the 3 days the whole college stuff was happening. We didnt do it the last day cause they realized something was wrong and printed out a different ticket. So we didnt go, also because they were being suspicious and asking questions. Do you think we are getting punished?it was only like 25 juice boxes and sandwiches, that's it, out of the probably 200 or 300 there were there. This has me so preoccupied omg.",0,,,

But I don't wanna die, because I known a giant love (took 2 years to forget, with some souvenirs coming over sometms), worth it to suffer for that; and because dying is as usefull as putting a hair in the street. So, I'm blocked in a useless, never stopping suffering circle, because of the demotivating thing keeping me from completing something. So Help Me God. (Oh well, I don't believe in any god. Hope you'll not be bored reading that, and will be interested by what I'm telling (living). TY.",1,,"terribly useless, I'm blocked in a useless, never stopping suffering circle",
"Hei. I'm trying to start loving myself and stop harming my body. While I'm seeing a professional I would like to find someone who had similar experience maybe? How to start loving yourself? I have this huge problem where I hurt myself when someone hurts me emotionally to the point where I can't take it anymore. I just find physical pain more bearable. I used to cut and scratch myself. Lately I started to burn myself with this acid pen (used to heal warts) - i just drip that acid on my skin and watch it burn my skin. then I concentrate on physical not emotional pain. I know I can't keep on going like this. besides working out, finding a hobby, reading books.. what else can I do to take my mind off of that? is there something I could do while I'm at work? I don't really have anyone to talk with about this. Thank you, have a great day.",0,,,

I think about the possibility of my grandmother dying or my mom. I start panicking. I toss and turn. It‚Äôs 12 am. I start worrying about when my heart will give out. What happens after we die? Is there a better life ahead? How does it feel to have the life sucked out of you? The realization of my dead childhood dog of 15 years hits me. My heart starts to hurt. I regret not being next to her as she was put down. She must hate me. She must have been in so much pain. Alone. Scared. I should have been there. I‚Äôm such a coward. What time is it? Every position is so uncomfortable.. I‚Äôm so tired though.. I want to sleep.. Why can‚Äôt I sleep. Why does my mind have to think like this. I don‚Äôt want to be like this.

"I can't bring myself to enjoy anything social anymore. I can't be around my family because I'm sick of faking my happiness, I can't be with my friends because they don't realise the extent of my depression and I always bum them out by being too anxious to say anything. While I was planning my death a month ago, I got a message from my friend telling me she's getting a house with her boyfriend and I'm invited to her party, I was so shaken up that I didn't know how to respond and said ""cool I should be able to come"". I then deeply upset her for not congratulating her and she instantly started saying I was being a bad friend. She's aware that the girl I've liked for years is attending this party with her boyfriend (which is obviously extremely uncomfortable) but she told me to suck it up for one night so she can enjoy herself but... I just can't any longer, I'm sick of pretending I'm fine for the sake of others. So in the end me and this friend have fallen out ever since and I've decided I'm not going to this party for my own sake, I get the feeling that this will upset her but I just cant endure any more of this torment. I've had 2 suicide attempts ever since this happened a month ago and I'm scared I might try again if she messages me telling me I'm a bad friend. I just can't deal with any of this any longer, I can't be what people want me to be any longer... And it's not me being a bad friend, it's me being depressed and wanting to live.",0,,,

Debt is high. Work sucks. I feel alone in the world. I have thought about suicide almost every day of my life for thirty years. But I never can find the courage to actually do it. And here I am circling the drain again. I just feel like all of the stress and all of the unhappiness and depression will be gone if I just .... cease. I spent this afternoon researching methods. I even did a performative thing with a belt around my neck. Turns tour it slips out of the doorjamb. I know how to tie a noose and a couple kinds of slipknot. But there is no good place for me here to tie off the other end of the rope. I don't know what I want. Do I want someone to stop me?

"I was really happy until midnight and wanted my friends to be happy too. But after that it went straight down to doom.

"Basically, I'm a girl who turned 18 in november. I've struggled with my mental health for as long as I can remember (I started self harming when I was 12, but I managed to stop when I was around 15 or 16) and this year it's only gotten worse. My friends don't want to be around me anymore because they say I'm too miserable, or I'm ""always in a bad mood"". I suspect myself of having depression and I find it incredibly hard to get excited or happy about anything at all - I seem to have two modes of indifference or unhappiness. Recently (especially in the holiday season) my thoughts are consumed with how much I want to die, how much easier it would be and how little a lot of people would care. That, or many of my ""friends"" whom I thought the world of but I've since come to realise are only friends with me through circumstance, would suddenly care when they are nowhere to be found right now. At this point I have stopped trying to open up to my friends. I took a couple weeks off school last month in order to get my head straight and when asked why I hadn't been in, it very quickly became a competition of ""who has it worst"". I do have one friend who means the absolute world to me and I feel like I could tell him anything, but there's only so much you can burden one person with. I've thought many times about how I could kill myself and I have written notes out for my closest friend and a few other people - at this point, it's just finding the courage to do it.",0,,,

I felt empty before and I just feel completely numb and empty now, I don't have 1 second of happiness anymore and I just don't want to live through it. The pain is so fucking BAD. I miss how he made me feel, physically and mentally. I take medication for depression, see a therapist, and have extreme social anxiety. He helped me so much and I have nothing to hold onto anymore. I'm seriously broken. I guess I just want to talk to someone who is going through the same thing so we can go through it together? I don't even know what I'm saying.

"I'm currently going through some hard times and have no emotion towards it. I have ME (mialgic ensephilomitis), ME makes you become very tired very quickly to the extent that at times it even inhibits the ability to properly think. I have other issues but that's the main one. it first started in the middle of my freshman year, I'm now a junior. Because of it my doctors have removed me from any school and I'm to tired to do most things. This has made it as if I have been frozen in time while the rest of world continues forward without me. At first this was heartbreaking and I went through depression, however during that time I always thought that my emotions were not nearly as strong as a normal person's would be in this situation. Since then I have stoped being depressed but have also stopped feeling emotion towards my situation completely, both positive, negative and even neutral emotions, I just don't feel. I have also started finding it very difficult if not downright impossible to feel empathy towards others, or any other emotion for that matter and I have been left with only logical reasoning -when I have the energy to properly think- to an extent. So I am wondering if my lack of emotion is normal or not? Is there anything I can do about it because it feels very unnatural.",0,,,

"Feeling this way isn't a bad thing. Something that is said to much in our society is that feeling suicidal if a bad thing.

Feeling suicidal is a perfectly natural response to bias, depression, psychosis, or any other horrible thing; you can't go near a fire without getting hot. There is nothing wrong with you for feeling suicidal, for feeling like you hate yourself.

I am only happy when I'm with a select two people. Neither of which I see often so I end up very depressed when I'm not with them. I'm good at masking it while I'm with people but as soon as I'm alone it hurts so much. I used to think that taking my life seemed completely abstract but now it just seems closer to reality. However, I know I would never because I have a lot to live for and a lot of people care about me. But I just need some way to get rid of the pain. I can't see a therapist reguarly due to complicated reasons. I was curious about anti depressants I don't know much about them but I just need some way to not be sad all the time.",0,,,

All it did was either do nothing, give me horrible anxiety in which I couldn't move, or didn't help and just made me gain weight.

"Preface, I'm a bit drunk rn, it helps numb this pain. A girl I knew and I had hooked up with in the past, then became friends with commit suicide recently. We weren't close but I'd consider her a special friend to me. We rarely saw each other, but when we did we had the best banter known to man. I'm doing great in school, have a girlfriend, got internships lined up and was happy before this. But now, since she commit suicide, the only thing that makes sense to me is to kill myself. I've had depressive episodes before but this feels different. Everytime my thoughts are blank or I zone out, my first thought is the fact she is actually gone. Last time I tried to commit suicide was 5 years ago, and even then it wasn't this impactful. &amp;#x200B; For some reason this girl's suicide has really fucked with me and makes me feel like suicide is a reasonable option. It makes me feel like I have a new purpose. I feel like there is something extraordinary waiting for me. I almost feel as if she is waiting for me. &amp;#x200B; I got home in a cab and cried the entire way. The cab driver said nothing. I said nothing. When he looked at me I felt he had accepted my fate as I had. Perhaps there is more, perhaps there isn't. But I do want to cry more, but I'm not close enough to the girl to deserve pity. &amp;#x200B; As I am typing this out I feel better. I feel as if I do not need to die right now but I do crave death. Just not at my hand. I accept being murdered, I accept an accident. &amp;#x200B; I just wish it was over.",0,,,
"I went to therapy for a few sessions and the book ""Feeling Good: the New Mood Therapy"" was required reading. The book highlights unhealthy thinking patterns and trains you in how to spot them. I've found that All or Nothing thinking is a root to much of my hopelessness and causes self fulfilling prophecies. For example, I assume that I'm going to suck at a job and never get promoted, so I don't try hard because I view the effort as futile. The prediction therefore fulfills itself. I recommend this powerful, encouraging book, it's available in B&amp;N for about $12.00. It's the foundation of all modern Cognitive Behavioral Therapy that modern psychologists use.

Like, it's pretty common to feel low right after the holidays? Does anyone else get that?",0,,,

"PSA: when someone takes their life, the wrong thing to do is reach out to their closest friends asking for explanations surrounding their depression and general mental state. You certainly DO NOT state that you wish the deceased had reached out to their friends. NEWSFLASH: THEY WISH THAT TOO! This is not a time to point fingers, dig for answers, or to share just how much this has hurt you (I'm talking to you -- the people who have met my friend once or twice) -- especially over social media. Depression isn't simple. It is not brought on by having a few bad days at work. It is not remedied by a change of scenery, a phone call, or a quick trip to the doctors. The people who were closest to the deceased are not here to console you. Life is not about you. It is about the people who surround you. It is a time to celebrate the persons life who has passed, reflect inward, and reach out to those who are in your life and ask for what they might need.",0,,,

The truth is I am afraid to just be who I am around people. I have seen how people treat others who are different. They can be mean and cruel. Their avoidance can hurt and damage, and their ridicule can cut and bruise. I have been on the receiving end of cruelty, and I would rather not go in depth about it.

"Apparently, people hate it when others talk about their suffering online. People figure if you're talking about how depressed you are on social media, you must be faking it or looking for attention. A sincere cry for help makes you an ""Attention Whore"" apparently. I hate it when people dismiss others' pain as insincere just because they posted about it on social media, and even going as far as to make jokes about it. Also, I hate people dismissing others' pain because of their age. I saw a tweet once that was like, ""If you're under 23 and claiming to be depressed, you aren't really depressed. You don't know depression until you're an adult"" or something like that, and that certainly isn't true. I knew two people, one in middle school and one in high school, that were hospitalized for weeks from suicide attempts. Please, don't assume others are making up their pain ""just for fun"" because more often than not, the person behind the screen is actually suffering. That's all.

Now it just makes me feel so alone. I can be talking and bubbly and I mention an interest and the person i'm talking to just nods in feign interest. If its over text its just stuff like ""wow"", ""nice"", ""lol"", ""cool"". You can just tell they arent interested because as soon as the topic changes they are so much more involved. Honestly its making me feel so bitter, it feels like no one cares enough to try and get involved with the interests which mean the most to me. I can be surrounded by people but I feel so alone because I know no one cares. I know no one cares about me. No one cares about my interests. Honestly its just gotten really sad. Out of context this can sound so selfish but I just compare it to myself - when I know someone I love is deeply interested in something I try my hardest to see what they see when they look at it.

"I just turned 20 in mid December, I don‚Äôt have a job, I don‚Äôt go to school and my girlfriend (of two years) that told me she wanted to be together forever and even shared a dog with me has been ignoring me since Thanksgiving.

Today I got a text out of the blue saying She wants to meet in person this week to ‚Äúmove on‚Äù. Every part of me still wants to be with her and it kills me to think of a life without her; especially after going as far as planning our futures together. I thought the holidays were going to be the worst of it, but I‚Äôm slowly realizing that when everyone is getting back into their routines I‚Äôm still stuck. I want to get a job and go to school and be successful, but I feel trapped in this dark pit.

"Hi! Was just with my therapist and she suggested that when depression says ‚Äòisolate yourself from your friends and family‚Äô, do the exact opposite. Seek them out. When anxiety says ‚Äòavoid all your problems‚Äô, face them head on. Depression has a way of convincing you that only the worst things are true. Tell your inner saboteurs to kindly fuck off! You deserve much better. This is much easier said than done, but if you‚Äôre like me and you enjoy being a contrary little bitch, be a contrary little bitch to depression!",0,,,

"This is my first time posting here. I have been mentally going downhill for a few years now. About 3 years ago my dad got sick with cancer and went through all the treatments, radiation, surgeries, chemotherapy and eventually when all else failed, immunotherapy. He ended up in the ICU on a ventilator for a few weeks until he ultimately passed away. This whole experience broke me. He was my person. My mom and I aren't very close. I have no other close family members. I definitely felt myself slipping once he got sick and then watching him get worse and worse. He died in April and I've been functioning but I feel fucking terrible most days. I wake up feeling so shitty, like complete despair. I feel like this planet and most of the people on it suck to be frank. I never had a clear cut direction or passions to follow so I find myself thinking about my purpose a lot. I do wish I could end my life some days but I know I never will. I go to therapy. I have tried some medications but honestly I haven't found anything that works. I don't enjoy anything really so I don't have hobbies. I do have a fiance. He is a saint. He's my only real support. He's been getting me through. I just need to know of anyone who has been this bad and came back. What meds have worked for you, what have you done to get yourself out of this? I had a difficult childhood too and therapy has brought up a ton of emotional baggage that's contributing to my mental state.",0,,,

I couldn't go to a fast food restaurant without her screaming over the phone telling me I'm out with a friend or I'm cheating.

"There's this thing that circles around my feed every once in a while, about how Eeyore is feeling low so he stays at his house instead of going out with Pooh and Piglet, so Pooh and Piglet go to his house, where Eeyore says he's not been hanging around with them because he's sad and low and not much fun to be around. So then Pooh and Piglet sit next to Eeyore and don't say anything, they just lend him their presence, with love and without judgment. And then, although he doesn't feel better, he \*does\* feel better. I've got people like that, people who have straight up offered just to sit with me, who don't care how low I am or how un-fun I am to be with, they just love me. But the thing is, the thought of having someone just sit with me while I am dying inside -- I mean, I seriously can't even bear it. As much as I would be willing to do that for someone else, I simply cannot accept being on the receiving end of it. What is that?

I'm an average student but I'm never good enough. I love art but they dont understand. They want me to be a rich doctor. That wont happen. My only talent is art, and that's it - I know it wont get me anywhere. I do nothing but disgust and disappoint. I really wish I was aborted, never born. I'm a burden, and my parents refuse therapy because it costs money and all they care about is money and my grades. They as well dont believe in mental issues. I've always been too much of a pussy to consider hurting myself, let alone, ending myself. I know I wont have a future, so why bother with going onward? I'm banal, a dead weight. I've done nothing remarkable nor contributable. If I do kill myself my parents will blame it on 'the liberal school system brainwashing me' or some shit. I just want everything to go numb forever.

I think that people who are depressed can be grouped into two general categories. Those who have been unfortunately mentally wired wrong and those who have experienced some awful trauma or emotional pain. I'm sure for many on this sub it is both. For me it is both.

"My mood fluctuations have not changed over the past year at all, despite me starting medication. However what I have noticed is that I'm able to contextualise thoughts and feelings a lot easier these days. For example I'm feeling fairly rubbish at the moment, but instead of the thoughts of loneliness and inadequacy I used to get with these feelings, I now just look forward to not feeling like this. It comes in waves and always has done, but I'm feeling it is affecting my productivity a lot less than it used to, obviously I'm more productive when I'm not feeling like this, but by Monday I probably won't feel like this. I used to have thoughts of ending it, still do sometimes but I'm glad I didn't. I'm much happier now that I know it's not constant. I hope anyone who currently feels as though they're in a trough can see that it won't always be this way, and there are sunnier days ahead.",0,,,

"Hello! I've struggled with depression and anxiety for a while now but more so anxiety. Depression was very random and I could usually find the trigger. However, for the past month I have felt HORRIBLE. I feel so disassociated with everyone and everything. Usually if I have a few drinks, I can easily socialize and have fun. But now, no matter what, I don't care what people are saying, not do I care to even engage in conversation. Even with close friends! When I try to act ""normal"" it seems forced and I often go ""blank."" I feel like I have to force myself to laugh or seem happy in situations that would usually bring me joy. I feel like I almost induce it myself. Ever since this started about a month ago, I'm so scared I'm going to feel bad, that I start feeling bad. My brain always wins. If I let one negative thought creep in, my entire mood changes and I can't seem to change it back to positive like I used to be able to do. What is this feeling? Have you been able to overcome it? I used to have fun and be the life of the party. Now I can't even force it... it seems so unnatural. Please help. Living isn't what it used to be...",0,,,
First time on antidepressants but I've been on them for 4 months now. I like the meds I'm on now and if I have an issue then I'll make an appointment with my psychiatrist is what I thought. But when I called my pharmacy they said I was out of refills. Is there any way I can just keep getting refills without having to keep visiting my Dr to renew the prescription? Is there a reason why I need to keep seeing this psychiatrist just to sit in a waiting room for 2 hours just to say hey I need refills?,0,,,

"Hey. 16M here. I‚Äôm just a wee little high schooler but I feel like I‚Äôve been through a whole ass war with my own fucking brain. For context, my depression got intense at around 7th-9th grade.

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm alone on this and I doubt I am, but it‚Äôs so hard to get motivated to do anything but play video games and smoke weed. Now I know I‚Äôll probably be told that the weed isn‚Äôt helping with my motivation, which it isn‚Äôt, but that isn‚Äôt the issue. My issue is that I don‚Äôt have any drive to want to better myself or to do anything other than what is fun to me. Am I alone here? Is this because of something other than my depression? I never do homework, I never study, and these days it‚Äôs actually affecting all of my grades and that kills me because I could get away with doing *some* of my homework and get amazing grades on tests and 9 times out of 10 I‚Äôd pass with a C or above. But now I‚Äôm getting Fs in my classes and I just want to quit. I can‚Äôt find a reason to continue being in this useless place we call school for my ‚Äúeducation‚Äù.

I'm not going to explain why I want to commit suicide, but I do want to ask what I should think of before choosing to make the ultimate decision.

"I feel a bit better with the drugs out of my system. I spent new year's morning on the beach till sunrise. As the sun approached, rays of orange and blue leapt between low level nimbostratus clouds painting a silky leopard-shaped canvas. Light etched it's way through the aesthetic sky-scape soon finding it's shortest path to the breakers below. I wondered if the love in my chest surfaced by this natural beauty was reciprocal in your heart somewhere.. though on second thoughts I guessed resentment might occupy most of our space there facilitated by my loathing and misery. Take it as obsession, ill-health, whatever, I can't walk around on a broken leg with a smile on my face. I went in boots and all, young and blind as they come.. Here's a thought: Perhaps staring at your weaknesses in crippling shame and regret is more likely to preserve the good in you than perpetuate failure over and over again, if you manage to recover in time.. That's a relieving thought I guess.. I remember when we fell in love.. I was so stupid. More words.. Just words... There's no one else.. Not that it matters..

"From what I've seen, people suffering from depression feel down even though things around them are somewhat okay. As for me, I just got divorced, my ex-wife is an incredibly manipulative narcissist, and we have a young child together. She's accused me of horrible things that I would never do in a failed attempt at full custody. I'm constantly battling her over our child. In the past she has successfully isolated and controlled me through guilt and accusations. She almost succeeded in manipulating the courts. The legal fees appear to be leaving me bankrupt. My thoughts are full of her, her constant false accusations and how to defend against them. I'm on a tenure track at a university, but that job is f-ed now because I can't concentrate on my research for longer than 5 minutes. So yeah, I'm kind of feeling down. My ex is abusive and is so good at it that the legal system and even women's abuse counselors will back her and protect her. I'm in therapy. Started going to church. Prayer helps me get back to sleep now. Trying to cut down on drinking. Exercising a lot. Still can't focus on work, so I'm now focusing on how to change careers and stay in the same area (close to our child.) What should I do? Am I suffering from depression? When this abuse and false accusations first started a few years ago, I thought about wanting to die. My career is f-ed now because of this. That makes me worry about future custody battles.

No dreams or goals. No pull in any direction. It's never changed. I hide my real self from everybody because I'd be labeled the sad guy if I did I make it known. Like, what's the point of this cycle if all I end up feeling like is horrible and tired every day? I don't want this as a life. My family don't know me, hell I don't even know me. I've got zero personality or character. Just a empty shell that plays a role. Life is and has never appeared magical to me. I don't care about anything or anyone and I feel detached from society as a result. I've done it all. Eaten a great diet, exercised daily, I don't drink or smoke or do drugs and yet my body hates me. Sick of pretending. Money is everything and you are judged solely on your ability to make more of it. I wouldn't wish this intense feeling of emptiness and loneliness on anybody. I want out. I really don't know what to do. I've tried. Therapy, meds. I hope I don't wake up soon. This life might not be for me. How pathetic I'm telling strangers. Nobody else. I have nobody else.

"I myself am clean from self-harming for almost 3 years. When I used to harm myself, I would do it in places no one could ever see, if it didn't work I used makeup to conceal even the smallest marks.However my friend's story is rather different. I saw my friends cuts on his arm, some weeks they are worse, some better. The marks of cuts and bruises are extremely visible since he often wears T shirts. Once I shared my battle with depression and self-harming, thinking that maybe he will open a little bit but it didn't happen. All I know from him is that he has troubles controlling his emotions and uses hurting himself as means of gaining control over the negative feelings. The thing is 1. I don't know how to react (should I ignore the fresh marks as if they weren't there and go on talking whatever?? Or should I bring it up?) 2. Should I suggest him seeing a professional?

Been through a devastating medical issues, three close friends died recently, lost my job and my health care and the fucking holidays are shit. Mostly my friends leave me alone, but a few have actually gotten angry at me for not paying attention to them. They say, ""Let me know if there's anything I can do to help."" and when I say, ""Buy my meds,"" they say no. ""Help me clean my house."" they say they can't. Etc.

Our whole friend group was separated into different classes and we all didn't hang out that much anymore outside of school. At the end of the year I found out that my 2 best friends were switching schools, one for personal reasons and one for sports reasons. When I found out I was devastated and wanted to switch schools for next year also. I looked at the school one of my friends was going to and liked it, so I switched to that school. Ever since then it seems my life is going downhill. I have a few close friends but we rarely hang out or text. I don't understand how they can handle not seeing their friends outside of school. My best friend lives in another town, so we never hang out, and my other couple friends live in the country far away from the subdivision I live in. In our classes there is also a huge gender divide, so chances are I will never have a girlfriend through high school.

I'm going through some pretty heavy stuff atm. This morning I could hear quiet static. It sounded quiet but it seemed to completely mute any thoughts and I could barely move my arms to grab onto something. I couldn't think and I was just really confused. I keep hallucinating that someone I know is standing in the doorway and then my vision goes blurry my head hurts then everything returns to normal, I start crying again rinse and repeat. I've got so many messed up borderline maniac thoughts in my mind and I'm scared of myself. Anyone else experience anything like this before? If you don't mind sharing your experience with this please post it as I would love to read them.",0,,,
"When I was 15-16 years old, I posted here in my darkest moments. I couldn't see any reason to keep living. I thought I was nothing special and the next 8 years seemed like an endless slog. You can look through my post history if you want. Since then, I graduated college and graduate school. I have traveled the world. I swam with bioluminescent algae in Indonesia. I've hiked among alpacas in Peru. I learned to speak Spanish fluently and connected with people around the world, and in my own country, who speak Spanish too. I've published my writing i multiple publications. I have fallen in love and had my heart broken several times. I realized I'm gay, came out, and I'm with the most amazing woman. I have a career that I love where I help people every day. I can honestly say that depression may be a lifelong struggle for me, but it is possible to recover and develop tools to cope with it. Every day is a manageable challenge now. Every day I am grateful to just be alive. I am SO GLAD that I didn't kill myself 8 years ago. I never would have known how beautiful my life could become. Before you think about killing yourself, remember that you don't know how beautiful your life could become. How could you? You have no way of knowing until you get there. But you need to be alive.",0,,,
"Whenever I am in bed trying to sleep, I always lay there for another 2-3 hours just trying to see how I got to the point where I am, it always ends with me feeling too bad to even think about anything anymore and I essentially cry myself to sleep.The lack of sleep caused my grades to plummet as I can never focus in class.

What's even worse about staying in my room for long periods of time is that I'm stuck with my thoughts. No matter what I do on the internet to distract me, there will always be something that triggers my sad thoughts .. and then make me cry for 15 minutes straight.

i‚Äôve been going thru a pretty big rough patch i‚Äôve the last month and so the small amount of time i‚Äôve spent at home has been devoted to either drinking smoking or sleeping so it‚Äôs become an absolute disaster. so i decided to take the next two days and devote them to cleaning up my apartment. i can‚Äôt remember who commented it but i remember seeing someone saying that even just doing one load of laundry or making their bed helps them a lot. i don‚Äôt post much in this sub but i sure do lurk a lot and i just wanted to thank everyone that comments and reply‚Äôs to stuff. i just want to let you know that you‚Äôre not only helping the person who‚Äôs post you‚Äôre commenting on. you can be helping countless other people like me who just sit back and read and i want to thank this whole community. i don‚Äôt know if cleanings gonna help me in the long run and i know it won‚Äôt fix all my problems but it‚Äôs a start. and idk if whoever‚Äôs reading this needs to hear it but the small things matter. even if it‚Äôs picking up all your dirty clothes and putting them into the hamper. the smallest things can make a huge difference. if you‚Äôre reading this i love you thank you for making this community what it is. we‚Äôre gonna all get thru this one step at a time. keep your heads up.,0,,,

"I play on Playstation. The only friends I felt I‚Äôm actually close to (save 2/3 people at my school) are on Playstation.

I was shocked. I didn‚Äôt know what to say. I guess know I kind of admire him for getting over it and going through it. I‚Äôm scared to tell anyone else. I have suicidal thoughts and tendencies, I feel unmotivated and cannot get to sleep. I also usually can‚Äôt get out of bed in the morning.

"hello. i really cannot hang on anymore. i have been genuinely contemplating suicide since i was in 7th grade (currently a senior in high school) and tonight has been really tough. first off, i have been to school 2/8 of the past days it has been in session. i have a metric fuckton of homework to catch up on that i really have no motivation to do. my mom has been having problems with her legs and compulsive picking for years but it has totally came to a head recently. backstory: she got sprayed with raw sewage a couple of months ago due a plumber trying to install our washer in some piece of shit landlord's apartment. she has worms coming out of the scabs. i thought she was legitimately developing some kind of hallucinogenic disorder but i saw them. with my own two eyes. she forced me to see them. it was awful. she still hasn't gone to the hospital, my dad is pressuring her to push it off. all of the adult figures i have that once believed in me (all at school [teachers] due to how unstable my parents are) are genuinely disappointed with me. my friends have barely reached out to me. when they do i can tell how annoyed they are that i am struggling. i feel like it would be so much easier for me to die. maybe it would prevent other suicides, they're ignoring SO many red flags. i just want the pain to stop. please god or whatever is out there help me.",0,,,

"I'm a girl in my mid twenties who has two friends, a job that's steadily decreasing my hours, no car, and no real hobbies. I've struggled between keeping myself entertained, keeping my depression at bay, and balancing my anxiety with my attempts at socialization. But I feel like no matter what I do, I always end up feeling alone. I used to be parts of groups, used to make friends in school, used to have things to do outside the house. But now I feel like I'm going through the motions of each day and not taking anything away from them. The worst part is feeling alone when I'm surrounded by people. I was out just two days ago and almost immediately wanted to head home. I've always considered myself an extrovert but lately I've found it hard to connect with people. Even in my own home, where I have a few roommates, I feel like nothing I do to interact with them is ever enough. One of them is obsessed with his video games, one is barely ever home, and the other one is dealing with anxiety issues of her own that I always feel like I'm bothering her when I try to hang out. And now the icing on the cake is last minute cancelation of our New Years plans (for valid reasons), but then instead of the four of us watching the ball drop together, everyone went to bed early leaving me yet again alone. Now I'm ringing in the New Year crying and writing this down, hoping if I make sense of my crippling loneliness, then there's hope in 2017 I can do something about it.",0,,,
"I felt too overwhelmed balancing graduate-level schoolwork and a paid internship, and I felt like I wasn't getting as much done as I would have liked, wasting a lot of time. So I asked my advisor via email if I could end my contract early, for the research position I was given. He accepted the resignation, but I've been nervous bringing it up for weeks now. I was worried because I've been coming in late or on some days not at all. My depression is getting worse, and I feel like my antidepressant dosage is too low to be effective. I'm not sure which is a bigger black mark on my resume/needing a future recommendation for a job: not showing up to work because I'm having a depressive episode, or ending the internship to spare them from further episodes. It's the first time I've been employed as a STEM major, and I've completely messed it up. I only have rent money left and then, who knows. I feel so shitty and small, and mostly stupid. I can't possibly say that I've changed my mind now, it'll look too odd after all the rigamarole I went through trying to quit, emailing various advisors and internship coordinators. I'm so tired, and my boyfriend thinks that I've shot myself in the foot and yelled in disbelief. ""I don't know how to make it better,"" he said. I just don't know what to do.

It was crazy, because no one has ever talked to me about things like that. Then, on the way to the pub, a group of girls basically called me unattractive. Funny how girls are never shy about calling me ugly, but they're apparently too shy to ""approach me"". I never get signals, I've had shit luck on dating sites, no one ever approaches me, no one has ever had a crush on me, and my family are the only people that call me handsome.

But because of the particular struggles I've had throughout my life combined with the crippling depression and anxiety I experience everyday, I can't think of a way to put my capabilities to good use. Like one of the aforementioned posts on this thread, I sometimes have brilliant flashes of motivation and determination and start researching opportunities and ideas of what to do with my life, only for them to falter away and leave myself completely unmotivated/depressed, bereft of hope, and unsure of what my capabilities are.

I tried to be optimistic about it, and to have my new year's resolution be some bullshit like ""talk to more people"" but I know that's not going to happen. I'm so socially awkward I can't start a conversation, and nobody wants to talk to me. I've also thought of talking to a therapist about it, but that will never happen.

"So I just recently joined Reddit and therefore, I've never done this before but I'm lost and I honestly need to share some of these thoughts I'm having and this group is the only place I feel like I can do that. I don't really know where to begin but suicide is something I have been thinking about constantly. I don't want to wake up, I don't want to be anywhere or with anyone, and I don't even want to sleep anymore and that's the only thing that would numb my depression (because I wasn't awake to feel it). I feel so incredibly lost and I can't help but to want so badly to end it all. I keep wishing something would push me over the edge enough to give me the strength to finally kill myself. Everything's just so dark and honestly I could go on forever but my brother-in-law just walked in and I have to pretend like I'm okay again so I guess I'll stop there.

And finally last night I told her everything and she was the first person to not down play my problems or end the friendship on the spot.

"Hey guys. This might sound funny to you (it sounds funny even to me lol), but i'm really ashamed of my past. I'm 17 year old, and about 5 months ago I shaved my head. Previously, I had mid-sized hair and I was a cute guy, but when I cut my hair I looked really really bad. Some people even couldn't recognise me. But that's not everything - one day I got drunk with my friend and we shaved the ends of our eyebrows (yeah, we really did it), so I looked like a serial killer or a pedophile... I literally wanted to cut my whole head next morning. Few days later, I was at brother's birthday party and I took some photos with him and his friends, and one of the guys posted the photo of us on facebook. He didn't tag me, but he tagged my friend, who is in my class. He even put a cover photo with me and some other guys... Now, here comes the real problem... A few weeks ago, I met a girl through one of my classmates (not the one I mentioned before), and now we're in relationship. Now, I'm scared that he could maybe tell her about my hair-shaving, or that my girlfriend could find my bald photos (4 of them) on facebook. Yes, I know this is a really funny and strange story, but I don't know how to deal with this... I'm thinking about this whole day.

"Everything is falling or has fallen apart. My dad killed himself several years ago because my mom left him for some douchebag with money. My dog followed three months later. I got an incurable STD from someone I trusted but shouldn't have. Ive lost my license, and my car. Im trapped in a dead end janitorial job that Ive been maxed out in for the last 3 years. My spare income goes towards weed, so I can keep myself blithe and functional. All I can do is go to work in a few hours and pretend everything is cool. Nothing will ever change. I'll always be poor. I'll always be lonely, I'll always be depressed. The woman I've been talking to is married, and on top of it, I think is close to dumping me for another side guy. I could be imagining that. Things have been different for several weeks. Then since we've gotten closer to the New Year, she distanced herself more and more. I think she's trying to get me to break up with her so she can move on guilt free. I don't know. We barely communicate. It seems like she has better things to do. My intentions are to continue suffering through life, chain smoking, pounding sugar, and eating junk, until I get diabetes, heart disease, or cancer, and let it go untreated to kill me. I have tremendous respect for people who have the balls to kill themselves. Im not strong enough to be one of them. I wonder if I'm even depressed or just too fucking lazy to do anything for myself..? I just don't want to live.",0,,,
Forgive me if I sound extremely stupid but I've finally convinced myself after years of ignoring my depression to go see a doctor. I'm confused as to how the process works if a person does get prescribed medication. I know there are tons of different kinds of medication so how does the doctor know which one to prescribe? Do you have a say in which antidepressants you're leaning towards? I know some of them have severe side effects so I'm wondering if after they've talked with you to inspect you if they give you a choice from a list they feel is best or if they usually start you off the bat with one kind of medication without questions asked.,0,,,
"Hello! Long time lurker, first time poster. In the interest of staying alive until my new dosage of medication kicks in (and hopefully works), my therapist suggested I stay distracted.

One of which is, I'm the baby of the family...and I fear that I was babied so much that I was never actually punished or told what was right and what was wrong. I feel like my parents just didn't care anymore at that point because my first 3 sisters were exhausting. They just appeased me. Or tried too. The second is...was/is my perception of reality messed up, in more ways than I care to type out right now...or is am I just a brat that never learned her lessons...how the hell do I deal with it either way?

What did I do to deserve this? Is it because I exist? Not letting me live wasn't enough punishment.

"22m. I take treatment for anxiety and depression. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs helping or not, because some days, both before and after starting the SSRI, I feel normal and friendly, others I feel angry and unable to have a conversation with anyone because I fear talking to other people so much, and also because the thoughts and images in my head are racing so fast I cannot slow them down fast enough to collect a thought to speak. I only answer either ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno‚Äù on those days. I could have a few normal days in a row only to have them followed by a week of being afraid of everything. My eyes have been also more sensitive to light lately, if that means anything. In the background of all this is a strange sensation that I‚Äôve been told by several people is only a symptom of depression. I have no emotions or interests. I don‚Äôt want to talk or see anyone. Nothing in the world around me seems real, I don‚Äôt recognize myself or my thoughts, and I feel as though I‚Äôm watching myself go through the motions of life. Thoughts of my death and killing myself randomly enter my head every day, sometimes for no reason at all and other times is I‚Äôm uncomfortable or embarrassed, but I‚Äôve never thought seriously about harming myself. It‚Äôs more as though it‚Äôs a thought I observe and don‚Äôt interact with. I don‚Äôt know why, but my day-to-day thoughts make me feel as though I am an aged older man than a 22-year-old. It‚Äôs like my brain feels exhausted. My questions though: is this normal? How do other people deal with this if so? My head just makes me want to never leave my bed,",0,,,

"I recently started dating my Deaf friend and she opened right up to me about how she had depression and contemplated suicide a few years ago. She says she felt like a burden to the people around her. Having to learn a new language just to talk to her, not listening to her because they don‚Äôt understand her voice, and not wanting to communicate with her at all. We watched a movie the other day at my house and she fell asleep on my chest. I rolled up her sleeve because it was getting caught on my watch, and I saw a massive amount of old scars on her left arm. I pulled her sleeve right down and just thought for a second. I‚Äôve never seen her without a long sleeve shirt or a coat on. Even though I‚Äôve been one of her closest friends for years. She obviously cuts herself, or used to cut herself as the case may be. She has apparently been feeling heaps better recently so thats great, she says she learnt to smile, and that she learnt there are people that care for her. And I believe her. But what if this happens again? What if she has another rough trot? What am I to do, I feel like I won‚Äôt be enough to stop her. Even if she is past this, I‚Äôm worried.

"When I was severely depressed, my therapist recommended using distraction to prevent myself from being consumed by flashbacks of former trauma.

"Hey, I've struggled hard with depression and I'm currently grieving a suicide of a loved one. Not feeling too great at the moment. I'm offering a song to any of you who want one.

It's just the person is special and I'm not, and if I lose her as a friend then I'll never find someone like that again. I don't blame her, I bring all my problems to her and she's deeply caring but I think that's just the way she is.

""You have everything, you have no reason to be depressed"" those words are what got me to fall deeper. Nonetheless, I thought having my bf would be another solution and ya he was trying but now he is being so cold and saying he feels suffocated. I feel so humiliated to have even thought I count on him and now im sending apologies to him. ""Im sorry im depressed"" ""I feel guilty being a depressed gf"" ""R u tired of me"" ""I will stop talking about my depression if it makes ends meet and just be together...i am scared and dont wanna be alone"" I hate how everyone tosses me like im a strong thing but im so fragile. I am a coward to even be suicidal, cause of course I dont feel like its the solution. But to not exist...I often think about it. I wanna escape im so tired of feeling like I cause burden to ppl and my bf is giving up...my parents dont understand...im running out of options and breaking down. And all drs want is to put medication after medication and I'm done. I hate how i have to understand how ppl react to my depression when they should understand me. How fucked up is that.??

And the counseling was done on campus, I was referred to several therapists/psychologists/specialists/etc to continue work but I don't have a car and counseling on campus is very limited in the amount of sessions you can do (10 per 2 semesters/or per issue).

"warning: fairly negative post. Feeling lonely &amp; not having friends used to bother me a lot. I thought having people reaching out &amp; caring about me would help me feel better about life. Then I started a program in college where everyone is really ""tight"" with each other. So now I'm not totally isolated like going weeks without talking to people, like it was before. These people are nice, fun &amp; share the same interests as me. There's no reason I couldn't be friends with them. But these relationships don't make me not want to erase my existence anymore, or pull me out of a shell, more confident, cheerful every once in a while, ad nauseum. It's not that they're ""not enough"" or something, it's just that nothing can fix me. I guess this past year has really proven that to me. That element of ""I wish ____ would just contact me, it would prove I'm not worthless and someone cares"" is gone, and it's honestly a relief. Kind of like sinking into a somewhat comfortable void. But it definitely scares me for the years to come. I'm supposed to live for 60+ more years like this? I'd rather not.",0,,,
"Hello, I'm 19 yo and I'm 5 years thinking I'm a burden to everyone, I got bullied for several years due I'm the lower of all my ""friends"". I really don't know what to do, I want to kill myself but I don't have the courage to do that. No one will appreciate me for my entire life.",0,,,
"Isolation. I mean complete isolation. (With the exception of interacting with co-workers at my job and when I have to go grocery shopping of course.) This year my depression was at it's worst. It caused me to drink non-stop and I just got worse and worse. And I just can't be around people. Somewhere along the line I have lost who I am and I hate myself. So I feel before I can face my depression in social situations, I need to learn to be by myself and love myself once again. This may not be the healthiest solution to most people, but for me I feel it's most needed.",1,complete isolation,"I have lost who I am and I hate myself, I need to learn to be by myself and love myself ",
"I've always been someone who has a small circle of very close friends and not much else and I'm fortunate that my current friends are wonderful people and very supportive of me, but I still feel very insecure in my relationships with them. Leaving high school has been very good for me, but I think to some extent I've sabotaged my own recovery and kept myself constantly sad out of fear that if I'm not in need of emotional support that my friends will leave me because I won't have anything to offer. Recognizing this has been good for me but I still am afraid that my friendships will naturally peter out because of my own deficiencies as a person. Does this make me a bad friend? I feel like I've been manipulative and an unnecessary burden and I don't know if that's a product of my own self-dislike or a reasonable reaction to my behavior.",1,,"feel very insecure in my relationships, my own deficiencies as a person, I feel like I've been manipulative and an unnecessary burden",
"OK, let me start this off by saying on the outside I‚Äôm laughing and joking to cover these feelings up. Tired of life Hard time waking up Always fall to sleep using phone (guess it prevents me thinking) Bad thoughts when lonely Man even work sucks, I work hard, 80+ hours a week at least and spend longer chasing my wages happened with at least 8 company‚Äôs within 3 year gap. Feel like I‚Äôm literally hitting my head against the wall. Within a space of 2-3 months I had third degree burns to feet due to accident not my fault, and when I finally got back to work I now have a hernia. Is this just unlucky?! Had my palms / cards read by clairvoyant 2 years ago she mentioned my future consists a lot of pain and suffering, didn‚Äôt want to tell me you could see that in her face. Even my school days weren‚Äôt great; debagged in public, constantly hit in testicles throughout school (had to have an operation to remove cyst down there) Is this depression / anxiety? I just need to get answers to help. No one seems to know how I feel inside, I guess I just hide it well.",0,,,
"no matter what happens or what i do, i always end up crying begging for my life to end desperately in the middle of the night. i can't run from my own thoughts or feelings, it controls me. why is death so hard despite the strong need for it to happen :(",0,,,
"I'm tired, I'm trying so hard, I want to be happy but I don't know what to do, I have no one to talk too and no matter how I try it seems like I can never be better or good enough.

"It's been horrible these last few years trying to make something out of myself. I still don't trust my own opinions, my parents have full control of my life, and I'm refused medical help. So this year either I make a turnaround, moving out and being able to get help, or I end my life before it can get any worse. I see very little chance for the former.",1,"parents have full control of my life, refused medical help",don't trust my own opinions,end my life
"Finally get to a dr. and try some meds for the umpteenth time. Cost me $300 a month out of pocket. Absolutely no change 6 plus months later. Now let‚Äôs try some different meds, right? It‚Äôs always that...or I‚Äôm not doing enough. Well point being I can‚Äôt continue with this wretched disease posing my thoughts, relationships and life. Seriously at a loss. I‚Äôve tried extensive meditation, SSRIs and a host of other meds, drugs, quit alcohol completely for almost two years, regular exercise, first etc. Nada. Nothing. This is me. It‚Äôs hell having to ‚Äúlive‚Äù like this if you can call it living.",0,,,
"i guess my parents had a mini intervention today where they asked me if i was depressed. i denied it, but if they can see it maybe im not as okay as i thought. i have a huge wall built around me, i dont tell anyone anything, how do i ask for help? im so frustrated and tired of feeling this way.",0,,,
"So for the last two years I thought I had depression. A few days ago I was diagnosed with depression. I'm starting to think I don't have depression and I'm just a bitch and I don't know how to tell if that's the case. The weirdest thing is, over the last month I've been increasingly feeling well. My life is shit becausd I missed lits of school and so I worry a lot, but that's normal. Other than that I feel.. fine. I don't feel depressed. Could it be that this is temporary or does this mean I don't have depression. The other thing is I was given pills but the thing is I don't want to take pills that might fuck me if I'm feeling ok atm. Advice?????? I need to make some decisions fast",0,,,
"On paper things should seem fine, the few people I've told I want to kill myself on a constant basis brush it off as me being hyperbolic or something. I think about suicide every day and I have for a very long time. Every day is just a physical underlying pain, that I can't really pinpoint. I just want it to stop. The depression or whatever, doesn't ever go away, no matter if I change my work, have money or dont, with or without romantic partners, or how my social life is doing. I can't seem to dig out any actual real trauma. I just want to die, and I think about it all of the time, but I'm just too much of a coward to go through with it, so far. I just want help to end this.",0,,,
