"Hi, First post on this sub in a while but I'm at a loss of what to do I'm so fed up of feeling numb and tired and like I don't want to exist and my brain is so fogged that I cant think straight I'm trying everything - taking the pills, doing the therapy, seeking advice and just nothing seems to be helping I don't like my job, but I also don't want to resign without anything else lined up and all of the experts and forums and advice systems just suggest trying to 'think in a more positive manner' and I'm really trying but it just feels hopeless, I get 5 minutes of 'maybe this will be OK!' then immediately back to the grey reality I've started applying for new jobs as my current manager has suggested that we get through year end then if I'm still feeling the same way then perhaps I should look elsewhere so I kind of don't see the point in actually trying until year end as if I'm not staying then who am I impressing? I have a 1:1 later so I guess I'll find out if it's time to leave &amp;#x200B; has anyone had this ? can anyone help? sorry just a brain dump cheers",0,,,
"Hi, I started college this year after a gap year and I went to a major that I was really excited about and I was preparing for it. It‚Äôs arabic language and history major. 2 months in I knew something‚Äôs just not right. One of the teachers is really demotivational and the classes were really hard. But I kept going because it was my dream to go to this school. Now it‚Äôs finals month here in Czech and I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I suck at the language, I tried but I just don‚Äôt get it so I told my family and friends and everyone just says that I cannot give up! ‚ÄúYou have to go through finals! Give it a try!!! You have to push yourself and do the best!‚Äù But I‚Äôm pushing myself I guess I‚Äôm just not pushing as hard as everyone else. But I don‚Äôt want to push too hard. I‚Äôm already really depressed I started going to therapy because of the school, I‚Äôm crying everyday. I don‚Äôt think I can get through. Why is everyone telling me that I cannot give up? Why is ‚Äúgiving up‚Äù seen as such a bad thing for people? My long distance boyfriend is the only one who supports me the way I need. He is motivational and he‚Äôs saying that it‚Äôs okay to quit. But you know, he‚Äôs not here and even though he is my support I need something to tell my family or just people around that they will get and not see as a bad thing to do (giving up).

"Last summer I started college in a new city away from home. I was desperate to find friends since I was in a new city and managed to make 2 or 3 decent friends and I have since lost contact with them for various reasons. Then I managed to meet a girl at my new job and I fell in love with her. Everything about her was perfect for me and I felt like we bonded really well, except for the fact that she had a boyfriend. She was unhappy with her relationship and I hoped to help her get out of a toxic relationship and make her my own. Today she friendzoned me and said she's staying with her boyfriend, and now I'm completely alone all over again with no friends and nobody I care enough about to live for. Sure, my family might care for a couple weeks but after that I would be forgotten forever if I was gone. I have no motivation to go and make new friends and I feel like if I talk to any new girls I'm just going to think about this first girl and want her back. I just want to end it all and never have to deal with this complete feeling of loneliness ever again.",0,,,

"It's been a crappy winter so far. Found out I'm going to be out of a job at the end of the month and I don't know what else I'm going do do with myself. My car is continuing to fall apart. I had been saving some money in hopes of buying a new one, but I'm not quite going to be there when the revenue stops. On top of that, I've developed a skin condition right near my eyes, and having it happen over the holidays has made scheduling a specialist very difficult. It's gotten worse since then and I don't think it's going to heal easily. Apart from all of that, I declined to go to a relatively important holiday party because I feel like crap. I already have a terrible social life, but I'm not making things any better for myself. Worst of all, I fell like I seriously disrespected the people I avoided and missed a once in a lifetime chance to know them better. I suck suck suck. I knew I was going to feel bad about staying home, but felling how I do lately, I just can't handle myself. Either way, I feel hurt pretty badly, but sitting home licking my wounds is a shame on me and no one else.",0,,,

"Another thing. My mom recommended I consider a grief therapy group or just a normal therapy group. I don't think I'm still grieving but I might be. I was in a process group many times, but I only sometimes felt okay with it. Some of the others had an idea of what I deal with, as far as crippling depression and at the time, a bad home life. But they didn't have DID or BPD. At this point it's either one ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. And the therapists, it didn't seem like they really knew how to help, like maybe they have had a personality case before but not on my level. I'm actually considering getting back into a group. Who knows, maybe this time they can actually help. I'm trying to not be so closed off. That's how it gets worse.

So for the past year and a half I've not been doing well. Certain traumatic events happened that had a lot more impact on me than I realized they did in the moment.

"So I don‚Äôt know for sure that I am depressed, but it really does feel like it. I dont feel loved or cared about. Like I am not special, I am nobody's favorite person. But I know this isn‚Äôt true. My family loves me very much. My mom, dad, sister, they all care for me so much, and I can tell. I don‚Äôt necessarily have feelings that strong for them, but I have never felt very strongly about anyone. Does that make me wrong? To feel so unloved even though they do?

"As the title suggests I could really use some advice. I‚Äôve been struggling with depression for years, with this latest episode affecting me since mid-November. It is now January 2018 and although I‚Äôve had some good times and didn‚Äôt really feel depressed over the Holidays, it all just came flooding back last night. All of my friends ended up bailing on me on New Years so I spent the night alone in my room until I fell asleep around 9 pm. I woke up around 3 in the morning and stupidly checked my phone. When I did I saw all the friends that bailed on me at different parties, surrounded by others, having fun. This sent me spiraling back into depression and I found myself close to ending my life with a belt which I‚Äôve read can be very painless. I was able to take some medication that helped me go to sleep again and get through the night. It‚Äôs now 1:30 in the afternoon and I still feel the same way with absolutely nobody to talk to about this because I don‚Äôt want to be that person that brings somebody down on New Years. It just feels as if no matter what medications I take, whatever therapist I have, and even with these group therapy sessions I‚Äôve been attending, I always end up back on the train to death. It‚Äôs starting to feel like the only solution as I‚Äôve tried making some major changes in my life and none of them have made any impact when others have told me they would. Thank you for reading and any advice would be greatly appreciated. -A",0,,,

"My heart is screaming, my soul (and my right arm due to self harm) is bleeding and burning, I am feeling lower and lower each day that passes, I feel more and more like I will explode, several personnal reasons caused me to feel this way (sexual bias, poverty, loneliness, studies, ill relatives, I am also possibly underdiagnosed when it comes to my mental health) but I don't know how to ask for help. I don't know what to say, and I would feel guilty saying this to the people around me because I will bother them. I told it to my best friend but she is suicidal and severely depressed and she started to self harm again after I told her I self harmed and I don't want to make her feel worse. I want to support her although I don't have the strength to do that. I told it to a friend and to my sister as well and although they are helping and kind, I don't want to tell them how bad I feel. I don't know how to. I tried to see psychologist but I have to wait untill at least april. This is a free psychologist and I can't afford to see another one earlier if it means I have to pay. My credit card has been stolen anyway lol. Anyway, my way of coping with all of this is to put myself in danger and make myself feel physically bad in the hope I will feel more valid in my suffering and that I will finally be able to ask for help and feel like I deserve it.

"I admire her so much. She makes my life worth living another day. My depression is so gut-wrenching and I often find myself struggling for a will to live, but her smile is so infectious and she makes me smile in even the darkest moments. But I need to emotionally detach myself from her. She doesn't even know I exist. She lives thousands of miles away, is super succesful, and has a loved one of her own. Does anyone else emotionally attach themselves to people (like entertainers, celebrities, idols, etc.) almost as a form of escapism, but know that you'll never meet them and it hurts? I personally am a huge fan of one specific band/group member, and she makes me really happy, I'm just trying to emotionally detach myself from her because I'm afraid her group is going to disband in the near future and she's going to be out of the public eye.",0,,,

"I'm a 38(m), and I've been taking Cymbalta for a little over a year. About 2 months ago, I started feeling very depressed again for no reason, and having bouts of extreme anger. I informed my doc, and she doubled my dose to 60mg. Since then, my depression and anger have gotten much much worse. My life is amazing right now. I have a wife who loves me and supports me through all of my depression and anxiety issues. She is learning how to talk me down off the cliff sometimes, but it is a crapshoot as to whether she is able to or not. I have two wonderful little girls, who bring me so much joy. Yesterday, I had a terrible day all day. I can't get motivated to do what I need to do at work, and when I do, I have terrible anxiety that I'm going to fuck something up and get fired. I spent most of the day yesterday shaking at my desk, because I couldn't even make myself move half the time. I got home, and had a fight with my wife, because I was taking everything she said the wrong way, to the point that I eventually just broke down crying for NO REASON. I cried for probably 45 minutes over nothing. These episodes are happening more and more frequently. The last time I remember feeling this way was when I got the bright idea to stop taking my Cymbalta completely, and that was an unmitigated DISASTER. I had a complete breakdown, and nearly left my entire family. I'm terrified that if Cymbalta has indeed stopped working for me that I'm going to have to stop taking it, and will end up having another breakdown. I absolutely hate my brain...",1,"bouts of extreme anger, terrible anxiety",I absolutely hate my brain,

"Hi guys, Never even used reddit before but a close friend of mine suggested asking for help on one of these to keep anonymous. Recently I've finished school and turned 18 (adulthood in Australia). For about 12 months now I've had massively interrupted sleeping schedules, and my body is used to only getting 4-5 hours sleep, sometimes able to function on 2-3. In the last 4 weeks, my thoughts tend to become darker, I feel the sensation of suffocation and drowning (I'm crying as I type this..) I hate the thought of professional help (counsellors/therapists) but I may consider it soon. I have a loving yet dysfunctional family, 2 brothers and loving parents. I live in a good home and have a part time job as a cashier in a supermarket that I've stuck to for 2 years. I'm waiting on university offers and if I'm lucky I'll be moving states to Melbourne City in Victoria for something along the lines of Law/Business. I can't shake these awful feelings, my brain feels continuously sick. Recently I've been experiencing alot of anxiety, something I've never ever felt before, usually I am confident and outgoing. Very recently, my job has made me feel extremely anxious and sometimes I hyperventilate if I'm lacking sleep and feel like I'm sinking even lower... its 3:10am on New Years Day as I write this. I don't know how I feel about disclosing what I think triggered this depression, but I will say I received an unexpected diagnosis after collapsing during work about 3-4 weeks ago. It's been downhill ever since. Please help, happy to answer any more questions, and sorry if I've broken any rules; I'm new to reddit.",0,,,

My greatest solution has always been to just sleep but these days I can't even do it that easily. Second best was video games but no matter how happy I am for my character I will always come back to the fact that it's all virtual and real life isn't that beautiful. Music was also something that helped a lot but I have no mood to play or sing and listening to it makes me sadder most of the time. Being at work has helped me take my mind off things but when I get home it's the same thing all over. It really feels like there's nothing else to do so I'm hoping that you guys can help me out. Lots of love to everyone.,0,,,

what‚Äôs the point of trying to better yourself when there are things that you just can‚Äôt fix? because in the end those‚Äôll be the things that everyone else laughs at even though you have no control over it. the whole idea of bettering yourself fucking sucks when there are things you can‚Äôt change anyways. what a sick fucking joke.,0,,,
"I am desperate for advice on how to explain to my 11 year old son what depression is. I actually have bipolar disorder but don't even know where I'd start with that one. My son gets very angry with me. He thinks I choose to be/feel this way and says ""just stop being sad be happy how easy is that?!"" I know I cannot be upset with him for not understanding, but I'm also extremely frustrated about it. He says it's embarrassing to have a mom with depression. That just hurts me even more. He went from having a happy, energetic, spunky, fun, thrill seeking, supportive mom to one who lays in bed all the time, is constantly fatigued, has migraines constantly, no patience, never wants to do anything, cries a lot, etc. I feel like he's grieving me. I grieve myself, so I can understand. But he cannot. He thinks I'm just being selfish, lazy, mean, etc. I looked on Google for some ideas but didn't find anything that I felt like going with. I've tried many times to explain it from my perspective, but he just cannot comprehend what I'm saying. I'm lost, and it's making me feel even worse. Please, if anyone has anything helpful I'd greatly appreciate it!!!",0,,,
"If I wanted to describe my life in one word it would be ""confused"". Nothing in my life makes sense, i've been searching for somewhere to belong and can't find it. I'm lost. -Culturally I don't feel like I have any sense of national identity. I'm British but I don't feel tied to that culture or any other. - Ethnically i'm mostly white, however slightly not ,so i've never felt at home in white society. I also notice many things about white society that are problematic. - Sexually i'd say i'm mostly straight. I've only ever been in love with women and sexually am only interested in women for the most part. However, I do sometimes feel affection and aesthetic attraction for some men, sort of like a crush but not sexual? This is another reason why i'm lost. - I don't like or relate to any of my family. - I don't feel tied to religion or atheism. - I've never been in love and can't seem to build connections with anyone. I feel so lost. I don't feel like I have an identity. I don't belong. I've always been depressed but I have no idea why. How can I find answers?",0,,,

She told me the only reason her and I never dated officially and stayed together was because she couldn't handle long distance relationships. but yet this dickhead is farther away than I was.

I don't want to bumble about waiting for something to excite me, I want it now, but I don't know what IT is. I have interest and hobbies but nothing that makes me want to get up early in the morning and go for it. I don't really know what I'm saying.

If I keep achieving things and I still have so many doubts that weigh me down or ones that leave me empty then what is the purpose of going on if you are always going to fail in some way. I used to also think that if I ever met anyone special that I would develop some confidence, but if I didn't get any after this goal then how will a romantic relationship help me?

"I‚Äôve learned that life is fucking sad sometimes. You start to think that maybe things aren‚Äôt going to get better at all.

I assure you, There‚Äôs always something worse than what you‚Äôre going through. It can get worse. Per that same logic, there‚Äôs always the chance it gets better. I think I hold onto that and you should too. You might have realised at some point, people in your life leave. They come and go, and the only constant in your life is you. You have your back, and that‚Äôs what matters at the end of the day. Keeping this in mind, Take care of yourself and be proactive towards seeking friendships and human connections whenever possible. We humans are social creatures, so having this emotional connection can literally save you. It saved me, at least. I‚Äôm sorry about whatever situation you are facing it right now, but do know that you have a power to improve it.

He has never tried to share any of his own problems with me. Ever. It was even like this when I was still dating him. When he texts me first, it's to ask how I'm doing. Any time I get quiet for a while, he stops contacting me. Even for months at a time. Then when I come back again, crying about my own problems, he's there to listen. Patiently. It's obvious I'm not his friend. He tells me he's glad we met. But he only talks to me for my benefit. He's doing a good deed.

I have been severely depressed for past couple of weeks and mildly since about November. I don't have a trusted parent, sibling or a friend that I could open up to.

My boyfriend just says he doesn't know how to help me and has phases of randomly complimenting me or texting me to tell me he loves me for two days straight then he forgets all about it. I'm sure he tries his best but I just wish I had more support and he says ""he can't help me anymore than he does"" everytime. I feel so trapped. I always have to pretend I'm fine. I always cover up with humor. It seems like I'm insincere or dramatic when I finally snap and just say I'm a mess. I can't afford a therapist. My university counselling office won't help me. They offered a suicide hotline numbers (?) and ""we're sorry but this isn't a psychological support that we do here"". How to cope? Where to go? Edit: Please don't advertise religion/cults to me.

When I would get home I would just feel empty and lonely and sad. I remember when I met my first and only ever girlfriend, My depression literally disappeared the moment I met her. She left me 8 months later and there is a very good chance I will never speak to her again. It‚Äôs been 3 months and I thought I was depressed before I had ever met a girl, but my god, the depression is 10x worse after I had one and she left. I‚Äôm so lonely even sometimes when I‚Äôm with friends I‚Äôm lonely. I can‚Äôt take this anymore.",0,,,
"I've felt proud of my success in overcoming most of my depression in 2016, and at least making some progress in seeing most people as good. But the end of this year has really taken a toll on me, especially after the election. It's not because of who people voted for, but because of all the horrible things on the Internet that resulted from it! I've always taken comments a little more seriously than most, but why not? If people express what they're really thinking on the Internet, than how can you trust anyone? How many people are friends with another race, then talk s*** about them online? How many people lack empathy for others? How many people condemn others for trying to speak out against hate? How many people really care? Despite thinking all this, I've still resolved to being a kind person and trying to understand others, even if their way of thinking is unfathomable to me. But i don't know if i can keep up the faith if this is how people really think. I just want people to be caring, but i know it's not as simple as that. I thought i was getting better, but i just don't trust people anymore. It doesn't seem like anyone really cares.",0,,,
"It‚Äôs a very long story but to shorten it a bit. I‚Äôm getting kicked out of crisis housing for having my dog which they knew about, on the property. Just gonna state here that she was apart of my agreement because she‚Äôs going to be a service dog for me. They‚Äôve now changed there minds 4 months later &amp; saying that I can stay but she can‚Äôt. I‚Äôm basically being forced to be homeless &amp; no one really seems to care. I‚Äôve been reaching out to those I love... but nothing. All too busy or something better. I know they say don‚Äôt give up, it‚Äôll get there but when? For the past 2 years I had cancer, after I found out I was in remission &amp; this program a youth organisation had accepted me, the Australian bush fires started which effected my family home.

"Hi all, been having on/off therapy past 3 years for anxiety+depression and more recently for PTSD. Been aiming to be a better person and all that crap. Spent the best part of 30 years being extremely defensive which has decimated my social life,its basically zero. Anyhow, I'm really feeling like I'm not getting anywhere ATM so I'm giving up on the therapy and meds and feel better already but not sure if its too healthy. Anybody else feel like the only choice of happiness is to completely shut the world out and exist only in solitary?",0,,,

"That's it. This isn't a new year's resolution because that shit is nonsense people tell themselves to feel better. I'm GOING to beat this shit. The last month I can confidently say has been THE WORST month of my life and I have been through A LOT OF SHIT during the last 27 years of my existence. At least during those times, I wasn't depressed (somehow). I know what I need to do. I need to find a therapist who understands what I'm going through. I must have been chipping away at a mental wall I built up or something all this time because it finally came crashing down after a series of thoughts and I NEED to tell someone about it. Someone I can trust. The fact that the simple thought of it gives me hope and makes me feel better means I know I'm right. I don't think it's a chemical issue in my case. It's a cyclical one, only eased when I drink several cans of beer before inevitably passing out since otherwise I WILL be up all night - no question. For the first time in my life I am ""looking more forward to"" (phrase used loosely since there aren't many things I can truly enjoy lately) work and this annoying festive vacation to end because I won't be alone with my thoughts. I WILL beat this. I HAVE to. And to anyone reading this post who feels the same way you CAN too. Sometimes, there are some things in life we just can't beat alone.",0,,,
"Possibly most of my depression stems from dwelling on things that happened in the past. Things that could have been and should have not.

"I hate to sound like *that guy*, but does anyone here receive any professional help? I went through this shit phase once, but I've got my shit all cleared up now. Yeah, I'm still alone or whatever, but I've learned to accept it while discovering a chemical imbalance in my brain from a trusted psychologist. I mean, with this generation it's like 50% are angsty teens, upset over simple things who glorify this shit then there's another 50% who seriously suffer. Who are mentally ill. It bothers me that this sub even exists, knowing there are so many people who need help, turning to an inappropriate source. I understand a support group, but I've yet to see anything empowering here. Just shit that'll make even the sanest, happiest person kill their fucking self. I suggest opening completely up to someone with a degree and credentials to aid you, not a bunch of kids on the internet. There could be something seriously screwed in your psyche and you may need medication or another form of treatment. There are also infections/diseases (and types of cancer, even) that can cause severe depression and addictions in people. Most don't find out 'til too late, when it spreads or whatever. Just a few words from my head... I wish you all a great 2018! My PM is always open!",0,,,
"Not really hahaha ... i fucking hate myself... to be honest , i don't know why i became depressed. I always feel sad and lethargic. I always have no motivation. I am always so shy and very anxious. I can't even speak properly to anyone who are not close to me. Reporting in front of the class is always a nightmare, I always get very nervous and always forget the things i'm supposed to say. I also don't know what I wanted to be. Choosing course on college made me cry for 2 years because of the fear of being on the wrong path. I'm not yet in college though but it feels like that i am already on the wrong track. I always don't know what to do because I don't like to do anything. Everything is boring...

I didn‚Äôt sleep very well last night and I returned to work after several days off and it has thoroughly and completely exhausted me. I did want to share something that I read last night that I have thought about ever since I read it. I started his book The Noonday Demon last night in order to properly understand my own struggles with depression. His article Anatomy of Melancholy (http://andrewsolomon.com/articles/anatomy-of-melancholy/) he wrote in 1999 for The New Yorker in which he talks about his own personal battles with depression have made him a huge advocate for depression and is very informative. Andrew also has done a couple of TED talks. My personal favorite of his can be found here (https://www.ted.com/talks/andrew_solomon_depression_the_secret_we_share).,0,,,

"Hi, everyone. I thank you in advance for reading this post. I feel trapped, I don't know what to do. Today I realized the fact of no longer having a family. My mom has a really rare type of cancer, my dad abandoned us when I was 1 year old, so I don't know anything about him. I haven't graduated college yet, I work to sustain myself, pay rent and food, while trying to finish my career and get my degree. But, my extended relatives who used to support me financially (since my mom never did it) insulted me for not spengind New Year's Eve with them. I got to live in another city because of my studies, and I am glad because I don't live with them anymore. I didn't do it for the sake of my mental health, I constantly get verbally and physically abused by those relatives and that has been like that since I was born. My aunt even tried to kill me. They didn't care about my depression, anxiety or suicide attempts. Depression started for me since I was 12, today I am 22. I have battling with disease alone, no meds, got therapy just twice because I couldn't afford more, but still they say I have no right to complain since ""they had horrible childhoods and I didn't have to sell anything on the streets"". I am really scared because I am afraid of losing my job and I don't want them to hurt me. I don't know what to do if I lose my job, I don't have close friends and my boyfriend is poor and still lives with his parents Any advice or opinion? I need help. Thank you. :)",0,,,
"I have nobody to talk to. I find it hard to open to talk to people about things. Sometimes if someone asks me something, I can just see in their face that they are losing interest. People really don't give a shit what I have to say about anything. I can't talk to my family about anything because I haven't live near them for years and they don't hardly know anything about what is really going on in my life. Especially not with my depression. My SO has been pulling away from me and left me all alone last night because she didn't want to sit home with me and had already made plans with someone without me and didn't even mention anything until she was leaving. I sat home alone and drank myself sick until 3:45 when she finally came home. She didn't even say a word to me. Whenever I try to talk about things, it just ends up back in a circle and we have been in a weird rut for a long time. I have never felt so alone in my life and maybe not as low as this in a long time. I just needed to vent things. I am not looking forward to another year of shit like 2017.

"So right now its 1 am on the first day of 2017 for me having been woken by some fools that actully celebrate such a thing with fireworks. Now I could write such grand things here like: - Every choice we make will in some way lead to pain. - The human condition is a curse. - If I have nothing to look forward to in the present or the future and there is no afterlife, what am I supposed to work towards? but the bottom line is that I feel sad and angry about how I am currently living my life and I have no intention of changing it because I don't want to or as I would rather put it to make myself feel better: - Because I see no reason to. - Because nothing will change for the better even if I try. - other stupid excuses like the ones above.

"Hey all, I've been on Lexapro (generic) for a couple years now, no issues. Currently 20mg dropping to 15mg tomorrow. This week I started Wellbutrin XL (generic) at 150mg. I feel good, little wired, but not bad. I'm concerned with the possibility of seizures. I've brought this up to my doctor, waiting on a response, but I figured I'd get more opinions. I have no history of seizures, no plans to go above 150mg. Any thoughts, am I worried for nothing? Thanks!",0,,,
"Depression has been with me for about 30 years. 2017 was probably my hardest year. I was at a point where I was depressed, anxious, and desperate. I was so scared and had no idea what to do that I called 911. It was the best thing I ever did. I spent time focusing on me. Not what society expects. I always had a tiny flicker of hope that kept telling me tomorrow will come. It's not much but know with every morning the bright warm sun will rise, even if behind clouds, and you deserve to feel it. You are heard. You are never alone.",0,,,
"I feel empty inside. Like I float from day to day, moment to moment. I don‚Äôt really feel anything anymore. Just this emptiness and hollowness in my chest, right on my heart. I feel cold when I look at people, and I feel nothing towards the things that used to bring me such joy. Will this last forever? Because this is not the forever I wish to have. I am numb. I have nothing left. Sometimes I feel a part of me reaching for the happiness I once new deep down. But every time it escapes me, I feel the void deepen. How long will it be until I can feel something other than complete emptiness? I can‚Äôt take much more. Thanks for listening.",0,,,
"In all shortness I just moved and tomorrow at noon I gotta hand in the keys for the old flat, but here I am on the floor in my old flat and have yet to empty all the cupboards in the kitchen and do all the cleaning. There's at least one large car load worth of things to move and I havent got a car or a license - so cant even rent a car and get it done. First I thought to walk with things (only moved a few blocks), like I have already done two times, but it's notably difficult to do so (and since it's getting late I'm contemplating a taxi. One can use a taxi for this, right?). I've had months to get this all done but of course here I am having procrastinated like hell and dealt with anxiety by knocking myself out cold to sleep. And since the support system is 99% parents I keep silent about this and dont wanna bother them more than this move already has. So yet again I've put myself in an utterly idiotic position of misery. Tomorrow comes with work again but I am honestly contemplating calling in sick and dealing with this shit between morning and noon instead of now (been here all day and it is now late evening). Another sad part is that today has actually been a very productive day compared to what I normally pull off. And this just sucks. Landing myself in this position sucks, getting myself out of this position sucks. When it's done and over with it will still suck.",0,,,
"I‚Äôve been struggling with depression, S H since before my teen years and just started to barely get hold of myself. Like just today morning my brain was like, ‚ÄúLIFE IS MEANINGLESS! I WANT TO DIE! LET‚ÄôS DO IT AGAIN! WRIST THEN FOREARM BECAUSE WE‚ÄôRE DOOMED!!!!!‚Äù And I was like, ‚ÄúBAD BRAIN!!!!!‚Äù Then I realise: Even if the situations triggering you are no longer present, even if everything is running smooth by others standards, your brain still relies on its default thought pattern.

I have googled stuff about depression and bipolar (not sure what‚Äôs the difference) but I‚Äôm not certain what I‚Äôm going through.

"Tried a couple of them, and I'll be honest with you: I absolutely dreaded them both.

I've heard from a few people who have taken therapy say that you have to find the right therapist for you. But hearing that argument convinces me that I'm essentially paying people to listen to me until I find someone that says the right thing to comfort/""save"" me.

"2016 has possibly been one of the worst years in my life, at least emotionally-wise. Yes, I've been progressing with my exams, I even got a part-time job and started saving something, but that's all that I've been doing. Last February my GF left the country to study abroad. Little did I know, I went to visit her in April and she broke up with me 10 days later. It's been a rollercoaster of emotions since then, and all I could do to keep me sane was studying and working. I didn't pursue any personal hobbies, apart from some sporadic gaming. I've been literally preparing exams and working almost non-stop and most of the time I went to bed very late. My soul has been sucked out; If I didn't have to work anymore and I finished studying, I wouldn't know what to do apart from staying on the computer. This new year poses some early choices I have to make. I want to do my thesis and continue saving money with my job, but I don't want to be working and studying without any free time anymore. I don't know how to live anymore. I feel like I need help, but I don't want to jeopardize everything like I did with my ex by exposing my insecurities. I feel that exposing my sadness would repel everyone around me. I feel my problems are too silly. Heck, I've been putting off this post for months now and I stopped halfway my stream of conciousness because there are far more serious problems to discuss about here than some indecision, burn-out and post-breakup trauma. Half of me keeps slapping my weak and fragile other half, but I'm not making any steps forward.",0,,,
"Long story short: In december I talked to my mother about how I feel and that I currently don't get my shit together; Mainly work. She asked whether it's ok if my family would know (If they asked questions after christmas etc) and I told her it would be ok. First thing she did was going to my aunt and telling her and now my whole family knows and everyone is super protective and sending help, which is exactely what I don't need. When I critizied her, she started the whole ""everything I do is wrong""-bullshit and now even my father called me, who is currently in hospital because of his weak heart and told me I should start using my brain. While I'm writing this my mother sits crying in the kitchen after she told me that she can't deal with this whole current situation and that I ""don't live alone on this planet"".

"Yesterday I stayed home from class because I didn't finish an assignment and when I told my parents they were mad. College is horrible. I can't get anything right and I feel like I'm in the wrong major, but it feels too late to change out for next semester. During my time at home I couldn't stop myself from crying. I stayed in my room all day, not leaving for food or the bathroom. I just sat there and thought about ending it. I had a belt I could kill myself with. It felt like the only thing to do since I feel like I burden my family and friends. When I put the belt around my neck and pulled, I couldn't do it. I couldn't just leave. My parents know I'm not doing good in school, but I could never tell them about what happened. I just need help but I feel weak or stupid going to get help. I really just wanna drop out and find a job I can work my way up from, but that'll disappoint my entire family. I don't know why I do this shit to myself.

I'm away from my family and I don't even have time to visit. I'm barely holding on now. I can't focus in class and I feel like crying even in class itself.

Do I have to stop doing this kind of attitude? What did I do wrong here? I didn't even realised when I stopped caring about anyone or anything, it just happened.

People say self isolating is bad and you shouldn‚Äôt do it and should surround yourself with friends and family but honestly sometimes self isolating is less hurtful.

"My girlfriend of 18 months broke up with me last March, I got over her within a couple depressing months. Then, I had bad acne, so I was put on accutane, and if anyone who sees this has taken it, they know how bad it is to take that shit, they even warn you that it can cause major depression, but I just wanted my acne gone. I was more depressed than ever, I hated my job, I was lonely, and I had nobody to talk to. There were multiple nights where I sat by my desk with my brothers 9mm, crying, wanting so badly to pull the trigger, but I knew it would affect all the lives around me. Somehow I made it through those 5 or so months of pure hell. Now the depression is somewhat gone, but I‚Äôm twice as lonely.

"Over the past few years of depression, my bedroom has begun to look like an episode of the Hoarders TV show... Thankfully without the bugs. Most of the mess was me just not doing laundry. My cleanliness standards were such that I didn't do laundry more than once a month, but still refused to wear dirty socks and underwear. So, being the high functioning depressive that I am, I would frequently buy new socks and underwear as I ran out and febreez my jeans and shirts between washes. The underwear took care of itself as I also gained a shit ton of weight and threw stuff out as it no longer fits, but... This week I'm doing laundry. I'm trying to clean my room (ugh). I've done 5-6 loads and I'm still not done. I have so many socks I can fill an entire basket with *just* socks. Has anyone else found themselves in this situation? How do you cope?

At school, Some students bullied and teased a lot. Fxxking sxxt I think I'm the most miserable person in this Earth. Huh... It makes me wanna die.

Nothing is motivating me today, I want to play my games but they get boring quickly, I want to hug my toy but I ended up throwing him halfway across the room when i was trying to get my TV set up to play my movies on my USB, I want to use my paci but I can't find it and there's basically nothing else for me to do.",0,,,

"Lately I've been panicking over the realization that I'm dumb as a brick, and I haven't achieved anything in my life. I'm 20 years old and just got my first girlfriend. I guess this is the only major achievement of my life, as she is beautiful and smart. Amazed we actually connected. I constantly have a feeling she's going to leave me due to the fact I can't keep up with her. She has achieved so much. Scholarships, awards, friends, and more. I did nothing in my life. My teen years were spent playing videogames. I did anything and everything I could to waste time and make my life go by faster, because I assumed I'd be happier when I got older. Unfortunately I've realized that I should have used that time to train my brain and focus on grades/academic achievements. Now I'm as dumb as a brick. I have no career direction. I don't think I'd ever be able to work in a field that makes serious money. I still don't have any friends other than one online friend, and my girlfriend ( who has many real life friends ). I've never had any real life friends. I don't know what to do. My brain is already fucked. My memory is so bad. I feel like I've lost the ability to learn. Once she realized I'm destined for failure, she's going to leave me. Then I'll be truly alone again. She already knows I'm not smart. ( not sure why this hasn't scared her off yet ) I can't take it. I hate feeling inadequate all the time.",1,"feeling she's going to leave me, no career direction, don't have any friends, alone, not smart","I'm dumb as a brick, I haven't achieved anything in my life,  I've lost the ability to learn, I'm destined for failure, feeling inadequate all the time",

"So I've been seeing a therapist for a couple of months now, and besides all the other upsides of therapy, I think my favorite and also most frustrating part is that my therapist confirmed that I am incredibly self-aware. To the point that she usually just agrees with me and I spend a lot of my sessions just talking to myself. Because I already know why my thoughts are irrational. I know I shouldn't let these things bother me. I know I'm not alone. I know this is an ongoing thing, I know, I know I know. And that's so frustrating. Because knowing doesnt make me feel any better. Knowing I need to learn how to like myself better and be okay to be alone doesnt help me actually get there. And when I get there, or think I've gotten there, I dont really feel any better. Yes, I'm lonely. I should learn to enjoy my own company and spend time with people who actually want to be with me. Great! Done that! Do this all the fucking time. But I feel the same. I'm still lonely. I still hate myself. Worst part is that I cant even blame anyone or anything. I did this. I'm doing this. I'm the problem. My therapist part of the problem is that I overthink and keep having these expectations for myself. That I should try to just ""do"" what feels right. But I already do that. If anything, I do it too much. That's why I'm starting to accumulate so much junk in my house. Idk. I just wanted to let the usual ramblings in my head out somewhere. I'm tired.",1,"my thoughts are irrational, lonely, expectations for myself",I still hate myself,
"I've been dealing with horrible anxiety and depression for the better part of 2017. I'm on a decently high dose of antidepressants now, which helped for a few months, but now I just feel like my depression is overtaking my life. I have no motivation to do anything right now. I need to clean my bedroom before I start my spring semester of school, and I don't want to just waste my break sleeping, but that's all I feel like I can do. I love to read and have been thinking about starting a blog for book reviews, which is something I'm still interested in, but I have absolutely no motivation to pick up a book or do anything except sleep or watch mindless TV. I guess I'm asking if anybody else has experienced this and if anybody has suggestions for how to get through this rut. It's so frustrating because I really do consider myself an ambitious and goal-oriented person, but the smallest things (even taking a shower or brushing my teeth) feel physically and mentally impossible at the moment.",0,,,
"(Venting, throwaway account for privacy.) My mind is blank. I cannot think. I don't want to eat. I don't want to try anymore. I've been trying for almost 30 years now. It hasn't gotten better like everyone said it would. It's just been a series of ups and downs, a rollercoaster that never seems to end. I fucking hate it. My partner's grad program fucked us over with direct deposit again, so now all our bills are gonna be overdue. Again. We barely have food in the house, and neither of us have had the mental energy lately to cook what we do have. I could pick up more shifts to work all weekend for pennies to try and slowly pay a tiny bit of everything off, but I won't be able to make enough to pay everything. I'll work myself to the brink of death again just to barely get by, smoke to get through the day, and drink to fall asleep at night. Or I could just end it all. My partner knows I'm mentally ill and tries their best. They go above and beyond any efforts I've ever seen, including my own parents. I don't want to leave them behind. I feel so guilty for feeling this way. But I just can't keep going like this. I want this to be over. And there's no end in sight. So I should just make my own exit.",0,,,
"I am curious to know why someone would help me here, but let's go, I used to be a very happy and pleasant person, at some point I became a negative person and a little depressive, I believe that due to the death of my grandmother (she always took care of me and I only realized how important she was when I lost her), because of this I think I felt guilty and started to see things more negatively, after that everything started to get worse in my life, even When I feel I'm happy, it's for a brief moment.

"Throwaway, because all my friends and such know my account. I know they care, and that's what hurts me the most. My head has always been a conflicting cloud of thoughts. I keep thinking if I were to die, maybe everybody would be happier. Maybe I'll stop being such a fuck up. Maybe everybody would think of me as this better version of myself after I'm gone. I'm young, and I know there's so much ahead for me, that maybe one day things will get better. But it's been so incredibly hard, and I don't think I can do it anymore. My stay at the psych ward made me behind in school, it made me feel selfish for wanting to work on myself, that I was causing pain for others. I sometimes think that maybe if I was gone, people wouldn't need to worry anymore. I wouldn't need to go chat to certain people to feel better. I wouldn't stay in bed and cry all day about how much I just want to disappear. I've been thinking about hanging myself, but after reading about how much it gets fucked up, I'm starting to think of a different method. I don't know.

"So, I‚Äôve come to conclusion that the worst part about depression is how easy it is to convince yourself things are fucking awful but it‚Äôs so so hard to tell yourself things are good. Everytime something good happens I can see a way to ruin it. Because I always ruin everything. My new girlfriend? Shes going to leave me because I am not good enough and never will be good enough to love anyone as beautiful as her the way she deserves. Maybe it‚Äôs kinder to let her go so she can find someone who really loves her and can properly show it. Not me. Not someone who sleeps all day forgets to text forgets to hang out can‚Äôt even muster up the fuckin spine to tell her how I feel. No wonder she doesn‚Äôt want to talk to me. No wonder she hates to spend time with me. I am a stain. I am nothing. To no one. Why bother? This is just some weird rambling. I don‚Äôt know.

"So my depression is *very* treatment-resistant. I've lost track of how many different meds and med combos I've tried. Recently it was suggested that I try TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation), which has been proven to be effective for depression like mine. My psychiatrist referred me to the doctor who does it, but I've been putting off actually making the appointment because I'm scared. You know how sometimes people don't like taking meds because they make them feel like they're not themselves anymore; like they make them feel numb or empty? It's sort of like that, except in reverse. I've had my depression for well over a decade, more than half my life, and I literally can't imagine what it'd be like if it actually got better. Would I still feel like me? I know that things would improve, obviously, but change is scary, and in a bizarre way, my depression is comfortable. It's been a constant for most of my life and I don't know who I'd be without it. TL;DR- I'm scared to try something that could work because I don't know who I'd be without my depression.",0,,,

"My depression has been at its worst recently and I‚Äôve been trying desperately to find a therapist. The people I usually go through have told me it‚Äôs a 9 month waiting list and I honestly don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be able to wait that long so they suggested someone else. I checked their website and applied for therapy and managed to book an assessment appointment for next month. I slept easier last night at the thought that I‚Äôd be getting help soon only to wake up this morning to a notification on my phone saying they had cancelled my appointment as they no longer help people in my area. I‚Äôm just so sick of trying to help myself. I know it‚Äôs not their fault for not being able to help me, but just that brief feeling of hope meant so much to me. They shouldn‚Äôt allow people to apply if they aren‚Äôt going to be able to help or at least have a warning up.

"Hey guys, first things first. Sorry if I posted this in the wrong subreddit. I've seen people getting through hard times and I've enjoyed helping them, I really like helping people and I feel like I might want to start a career based on this topic, I don't know much about it but I'm passionate. The thing is, I'd like to help a lot of people and I came here to discuss with more and more people, to see what are their problems, what do they want and what they didn't receive. Again, sorry if I posted here and I shouldn't have done this but I really didn't know where. Maybe if you wanna have a chat with me, to explain the basics of this career based on your experience or if you just want to get something off of your chest I'd like to hear your.",0,,,
"I moved to Toronto for school and no one came with me . Not one of my friends, or even other people I know went to Toronto for school. The only time I talk with my friends is when we play video games, and none of them show even any remote amount of interest in my life outside that. These are people I‚Äôve known since elementary school. I had another group of friends I thought I was getting closer with, we were supposed to go to a New Years party together. They ditched me, I‚Äôm not sure why, or what happened. I think it might have been accidental, but none of them cared enough to try and fix it. Also just found out the first group of friends had a New Years party. I didn‚Äôt get invited, even though I‚Äôm back in town for the holidays. And that‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs all my friends. Everyone I‚Äôm even remotely close with. That‚Äôs it. I‚Äôve been struggling with this loneliness ever since I moved, and this is kind of the cherry on top of the pile of dog shit, spending New Years playing overwatch with strangers and having emotional breakdowns at 4am. Goodnight.",0,,,
"Hey ya'll. I'm okay. I'm trying to be okay with being okay. I've been trying lots of things lately, and I'm certainly seeing the results of my bravery. I've sobered up. I just got a job that I'm super motivated about, and I think after a few weeks I'll really be able to rock the shit out of it. All in all, I've learned a lot about self-care and self-love in the past month. In the grand scheme, I feel like I might finally be out of the rabbit hole, and can finally get my life moving again. But at the same time, I feel alone. I finally accept myself again, which is the most important step. But I feel like no one else wants to share the riches if found within myself. I'm a pretty cool guy, I make pretty cool music, and I'm pretty damn funny. But I have no one to sing for, and no one to make laugh. And as much as I appreciate my own company, it would be nice to have someone who values me as much as I do. That might come off as egotistical, but hey I'm a human being and yeah I have an ego. Sometimes I still need someone to take care of me, and I feel like I'm coming up short. I could really use a companion right about now. Some one to let me know that it truly is worth it to try to be the best version of myself. Someone more than my mom and my mirror. If you're alone tonight, I might be too. So let's maybe not be alone?",0,,,

"I'm 17, and I fucked up real bad. Yesterday I went to a party to celebrate New Year's. I got so mad with my only friend that I told him to fuck off and that he should just forget my complete existence. When my brothers saw that they just tried to help me, and I told them too to fuck off and went outside to punch the wall until my hands started to bleed. I blocked everyone on Whatsapp, and now I'm completely alone and my family is worried. I don't know what to tell them. How do I tell them that every single day of my life is a constant pain and urge of jumping off the window? How the fuck I make them understand? I think I did the worst mistake in my whole life, and I'm afraid there's no way out. Suicide feels easier every day that passes, and now the will to do it is bigger than ever. I doubt I'll do it, but I'm starting to think my life has come to an end. That's it, I just wanted to rant. Wish you luck, and happy new year I guess.",0,,,
"My close friend told me, get help. Get help. Get help. And how I could be bringing others down by even venting, so I stopped. But the last thing I want to do is talk to a stranger about my feelings or not wanting to go on, feeling hopeless, and just fed up. Because I refuse to take medication or be ‚Äúcommitted‚Äù and the only other person who understands is my friend, who is also suicidal. People who don‚Äôt suffer from depression, extreme loss in life, or daily struggles don‚Äôt understand that we don‚Äôt exactly want to die, but these feelings have to. Is it just me? Am I the only one who gets annoyed at it?",0,,,

I overplayed it in my head for going on a week now and its brought my anxiety back and I've been feeling so low for a few days. At this point I'm scared to hit up my new friend because I feel so much nerves because of outside stuff going on. Life starts to look great and then bam my mind and my nerves can get in the way and put me in my shell. Just venting...I'm really not happy with how this happens.

"Hey guys, I've been really distant from people lately, friends and family and everyone really, I've just preferred to be by myself, apart from when I'm with my girlfriend but it's been like this for a few months now. I've gotten inconsistent with training and it's something that I'd usually never skip, I'm very passionate about and I have plenty of motivation for. I procrastinate with college all the time even though I know it'll make life harder for me in the long run and I've left my diet slip. I really want to be the social, healthy, motivated and driven person that I know I can and I used to be, but it almost feels like that person is trapped and being held back inside of me unable to control the me on the outside. I feel lazy and sad and like I'm not a nice person to be around. Maybe these all seem like obvious symptoms of depression, and maybe they seem like they're obviously not symptoms of depression and they're something else, but I just don't know, I'd be really grateful if someone could let me know if they think I should see a doctor about depression or if they think I need to do something else. I don't want to ask people to diagnose me or anything like that, and I really don't want to come across like I think it's that easy to diagnose or anything, I just don't really want to talk to friends and people irl about it, I think I could be more honest here and I think people here could be more understanding and knowledgeable about everything tbh. Thanks a lot guys, it feels nice to be able to get it all out in the open!",1,trapped,not a nice person to be around,symptoms of depression

"I have been taking Mirtazapine 15mg for a month and the last 3 days I've been taking Mirtazapine 7.5mg to start to wean myself off them. Like 30 minutes ago, I had what I believe to be a seizure. I was taking a bath. When I got up to get out I felt dizzy, light-headed, and my vision started blacking out. I sat down on the toilet because I felt faint, and then all I can remember is waking up on the ground inbetween the toilet and my sink, twitching. I am wondering if this could have anything to do with me taking Mirtazapine? I know the obvious answer is go talk to your GP, but I can't get in until Thursday and I'm worried so I would like to figure out possible causes before I go. Thanks any help is appreciated.

"Primarily, I don‚Äôt mean to mislead you all with the clickbait-esque title. I didn‚Äôt know how else to phrase it. Anyways, on to what I made this post for. While I don‚Äôt have the constant urge to kill myself, it does appear in my mind a lot. Every so often per week the urge will (for a short period of time) come up again. In those moments I find myself lying on my stomach on my bed, my hands either stiffly folded behind my back, so that I can‚Äôt do anything to myself, or out in front of me gripping the edge of the bed, so that I can not in any way get up from my bed to harm myself. I find this tactic works, but I wish I didn‚Äôt have to use it. You see, there‚Äôs are times that I really, *really* want to‚Äîno I *need* to cry, but no tears come out. It‚Äôs awful. I‚Äôm not dehydrated, so my body can afford to cry, but it just *doesn‚Äôt*. Instead I end up fighting to suppress tears at the most inconvenient moments. I feel so over-dramatic for making this post, because others who make these types of posts have *such better reason* behind theirs, and I feel as if my ""reason"", which is stated in the first few sentences, seems pathetic. Ugh, not this *really* sounds like some sort of woe-is-me pity party. Please forgive me.

I basically have solid evidence that 4/6 of the winners had hella connections and sponsors and that‚Äôs why they won. but still... it just feels like i‚Äôve wasted so much time and effort on something that was rigged in the first place. i was thinking that it would be like ‚Äúnew year new me i might actually work harder for some things because winning would be proof that something can come out of it if i try hard enough‚Äù.... but now my confidence is at an all time low and idk what to do.... sorry just felt like ranting a bit sigh",1,i didnt win anything,my confidence is at an all time low,
"My life, from an outside perspective, is objectively comfortable . I‚Äôm not terribly rich, but I have a roof over my head and food on my plate, with money to spare for my hobbies.
